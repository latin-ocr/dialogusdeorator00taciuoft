. PROLEGOMENA. xlix

while the writer 01 1110 Dialogus is ‘dulcis et candidus et fusus, ille
vi [melior], hic voluptate! And such, it is true, must be the super-
ficial impression which every reader will carry away from a perusal
01 the historical works and the rhetorical treatise, but it is, never-
theless‚ a one—sided one, because superficial. A closer examination,
as the above coincidences, intentionally selected almost exclusively
from the Histories and Annals, must have made tolerably clear, on
the 0110 hand utterly invalidates the assertion 01 Lipsius and his
followers that the Annals and our treatise, published more than
thirty years previous, have absolutely no stylistic features in com-
mon, while on the other, it as fully confirmer Lipsius' dictum ‘mutari
13 (30. 3111113) 111 aetate aut argumento potest . . ..sed numquam ita
ut abeat prorsus a sese.'

But 11 we must needs admit that remarkable stylistic coincidences
exist side by side with equally remarkable stylistic divergencies,
· all objections urged against Tacitean authorship, quite independent
of the weighty internal evidence already adduced, will be disposed
of, if we finally succeed in giving some plausible answer 10 the
following questions ε (1) How came Tacitus to write in the fluent,
exuberant, rhetorical style 01 the Dialogue ⁴? (2) How came he to
abandon it for the nervous energy, the studied brevity, and the
succinctness 01 expression, thought-laden to the verge 01 obscurity,
so characteristic of the Annals ?

We have seen that Tacitus enjoyed a thorough rhetorical training
preparatory to the forensic career which he had chosen. At the
time when the future historian began his studies, Quintilian had
already started out on his life-long crusade against the stylis-t
Seneca by preaching a return to the chaste and classic model 01
0131011031 excellence which he saw typified in Cicero. Now even
if it were not all but certain that the young Tacitus, like his friend
Pliny, had been a pupil 01 1110 great rhetorician, the treatise 113011
would prove that its author had at all events come under his influ-
ence, 101 30 far from reflecting the stylistic mannerisms 01 Seneca,
so much affected by the writers 01 1110 111110, 1110 Dialogue displays
not only a profound and extensive acquaintance with the works of
Cicero, as we shall see, but its very diction is saturated throughout
with Ciceronian phraseology. The documentary evidence 01 11113
1133 been collected in the Commentary, and the index locorum s. V.
Cicero will reveal at 3 glance the great extent 01 1110 author's

Ciceronian
influence.
