curs in Tac. H. III 75 invidiam crimenque adgnovisse. The state-
ment itself, regarded, bc it observed, by the speaker as one of the
many advantayes possessed by the ancients, cannot possibly have
been put into the mouth of Maternus, because of c. 11 15 nam

Stil p. 95.—Personal attendance, says Secundus, was in those days
compulsory also in public trials, but now even this requirement has
been done away with. See Quintilian (cited below) and Tac. Ann.
ΙΙ 35. John supposes that in the republican period written testi—
mony may have been accepted in private suits only, a privilege
subsequently extended to public trials as well. But this hypoth-
esis is not based upon historical evidence, as John himself admits ;
it takes ‘ quoque' as belonging to ‘testimonia' and is in any case
refuted by ³ magna etiam necessitas accedebat,' which, without an
express statement to the contrary, can only refer to private and

public trials.

‘in publicis' is the reading of all the MSS. As the phrase is unintel-
ligible by itself, and as the mention of public trials is essential to the
