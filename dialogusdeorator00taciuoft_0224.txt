uses et, ac or atque indifferently, Tacitus, in the D. combines two
synonymous verbs by et, but if the second stands in some causal relation
to the first, we find atque e. g. c. 7 8 8 22 9 16. 30 11 7 17 29 22 22
26 34 30 25 32 6 33 9 39 22 and also crit. note c. 20 7. —c. 6 27 15 2.

advocationum: desidia, as Wolff observes, is not found elsewhere
with an obj. gen, but may have been used on the analogy of negle-
gentia alicuius. Of. also Anu. XV 48 voluptatum parsimonia and
Dr. H. S. I 468. —cotidianum=cotidie. A predicate adjective for
the adverb is next to Livy, most frequent in Tacitus. Cf. e. g.

ξ 1069, 7.-80 also in Greek, cp. Holden, note to Plutarch,
Demosth. I 1, 6. On the orthography, see Quint. I 7, 6 frigi-
diora his alia ut . . . ‘quotidie' non ‘cotidie’ ut sit quot diebus:

See note c. 16 30.—ob1atum: On the ellipsis of esse, cf. c. 2 13.
