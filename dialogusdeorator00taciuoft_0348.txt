Prior. 35, 112 campus in quo exsultare possit orator, where Reid
cites many other examples.

‘Atticus' is the evident emendation of Lipsius for ‘antiquus‚' as is clear
from the context, for Aper is repeating some hostile criticisms on Cicero,
among which no such absurd charge as ‘parum antiquus' would imply,
could ever have been made; it is confirmed by Quint. XII 10, 12. 14. 16 ff„
and by everything that we can ascertain concerning the great struggle
between Cicero and the Atticists headed by Calvus; the emendation is

finally externally supported by the demonstrable interchange of ‘antiquus'
and ⁶ Atticus ’ in other MSS. See the variants quoted p. 22.

21 legistis · · · Calvi et Bruti· · · epistulas: None of these letters
have come down to us, and they may have belonged to that class
which, together with their answers, Cicero himself did not expect
to see published. Of. ad fam. XV 21, 4 primum ego illas Calvo
litteras misi non plus quam has quas nunc legis existimans exituras.
Aliter enim scribimus quod eos solos quibus mittimus, aliter quod
multos lecturos putamus. But Tiro, his litei-ary executor, like a
modern Froude, did not share these scruples. Quintilian has two
unmistakable references to this very correspondence: IX 4, 1 de
compositione non equidem post M. Tullium scribere auderem . . .
nisi et eiusdem aetatis homines scriptis ad ipsum etiam litteris
reprehendere id collocandi genus ausi fuissent XII 1, 22 nec Cicero
Bruto Caluoque qui certe compositionem illius etiam apud ipsum
reprehendunt. The remark of Cicero, quoted by Plut. Cic. 24,
was in my judgment also taken from the same source: πρός τινα
τῶν ἑταίρων ἔθηκεν ἐν ἐπιστολῇ γράψας ἐνιαχοῦ τῶν λόγων ἀπονυ-
στάζειν τὸν Δημοσθένη (Of. Quint. X 1, 24 XII 1, 22), for in the Orat.
30, 104, Cicero speaking quite generally only says that D. did not
satisfy his exacting taste.

23 Calvum· - · Ciceroni visum exsanguem et aridum: Cf. Quint.
1. c. haec manus (sc. Atticorum imitatores) quasi quibusdam sacris

eaesanquis, ἄψυχος aridus, ξηρός. Cicero often insists upon ‘strength'
as an essentia] quality in an orator. Cf. Brut. 9, 36. 82, 283 (in
reference to Calvus) de orat. I 13, 56. ——Other synonyms are ener-
