enough, has been forthwith corrected. In three cases (c. 10 4 12 5
20 15) a wrong reading has been correctly emended, but whether by
the first hand or not, Ι am unable to say. Finally, in two passages
(c. 25 18 31 31) A has fortunately retained the compendium, falsely
resolved in all other MSS„ which enables us to restore the original.
In general, it may be said that the corruptions, barring one or two
exceptions, are not of a very serious nature, being often due to the
scribe’s inability to interpret correctly the abbreviations with which
the archetypon, as we shall see, must have abounded. The curious
mutilation of well-known proper names also shows him to have
been a man of little learning. And in spite of his assurance
‘meliusculum feci ' he resorted to conjectures but rarely, and
these are, strictly speaking, rather in the nature of unimportant
changes than of intentional emendation.

2. The codex Leidensis 18 (Β), once in the possession of Perizo-
nius († 1715) contains the usual three treatises, the Dialoqus occu-
pying the first place on pp. 222-30a (quarto). This MS. was
discovered and collated by L. Tross (1841). On p. 11> we read the

following remark, written in red ink: Hos libellos Iovianus Ponta-

nus (b. in Cerrcto, Umbria 1426, d. 1503) excripsit nuper adiuvetos
et in luce relatos ab Enoc Asculano quaqua satis mendosas Ι M.
CCCCLX martio rTzse. and again in the margin at the beginning
of the Suetonius: Iov. Fontanus Umber eworipsit. These adscrip-
tions led Tross, Massmann (p. 10-13, 182-186)‚ Ritter and others
to regard the Leidensis as Pontanus’ own copy, which he was sup-
posed to have transcribed with scrupulous care from the original
MS. of Henoch (9). But these inferences rest upon no foundation,
for Geel long ago pointed out that the handwriting of the remarks
just quoted can leave no doubt that the Leidensis is but a copy of
the MS. of Pontanus3 nor is it at all likely that this learned
Italian, who recognised the mutilated condition of the text, would
have abstained from emendations.²¹¹ At a later period this MS.
was subjected to another revision by an unknown hand, who intro-
duced many changes, of which by far the greater number are cor-
ruptions of the text.²²‘·' How far this reviser (b) relied upon his own
