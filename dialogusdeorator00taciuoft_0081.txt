PROLEGOMENA. lxxvii

cannot be assigned to one sinqle speaker, be his name Messalla,
Secundus or Maternus, because of the heterogeneous character of
their contents.1⁶¹

Another theory was advanced by Heumann, who contended that
a lacuna must be assumed after the words ‘faces admovebant,'
because of the want of any organic connection with what follows.
The words cited he regarded as the close of Messalla’s argument,
while the remainder was assigned to Maternus. This view did not
find a champion till Becker¹⁶² strongly advocated it a century later,
with the modification, however, that he too assumed the preceding
speaker to have been Secundus, his grounds being similar to those
advanced by Steiner. But this explanation was also neglected or
rejected, until Andresen, fifty years still later, again returned to the
original hypothesis of Heumann,¹⁶⁸ adding, what his predecessors

· had failed to d0, a few passages as evidence of the contradictory

character between the two parts. Finally the whole question was
taken up anew by Habbe,¹⁶⁴ who in turn argues in favor of Becker’s
solution of the problem.

The great majority of editors and critics, however, obstinately
hold to the view that everything from c. 36 to 42 was spoken by
Maternus, some of these clinging to the belief that Secundus did
not speak at all‚¹⁶⁵ while others maintain that he did so, but that
his contribution to the (lebate, together with the close of Messalla's
argument and the beginning of Maternus’, was lost in the lacuna,¹⁶⁶
which they in consequence assume to ‘be one of considerable
magnitude.

1⁶1 When Steiner also argues that Pontanus (the cod. B is the apographon of
his copy, now lost) left the middle of p. 30α and the whole of p. 30b vacant, in
the hope that the lost speech of Maternus might some day turn up, his prejudices
allowed him to forget that if such had been Pontaxius’ motive‚ we should, to
say the least, have expected some space to have been left vacant after the word
‘utatur,’ and not merely at the close of the entire treatise ! Cp. also Baehrens
1. c. and Meiser p. 53 f.
