xxvi PROLEGOMENA.

,tation has always seemed to me singularly far-fetched and unnat·
urai, and it may safely be said, that no reader would ever think of
understanding the words in question in this sense, unless he were
deterinined to nullify or at least to minimise at all hazards any
awkward evidence that may be found in the way of a preconceived
hypothesis concerning the authorship of the Dialogus. If con-
sistent, Andresen ought also to have denied that the words in c.

both of these men were dead when the Dialogus was wi·itten.²⁸

The date-os Intimately connected with the dramatic date of the Dialogue and

Ξῖἒῖἴίῗὲἇὲζ- in a large measure dependent upon it, is the much disputed question

tion. regarding the date of composition. Steiner had, as we have seen,
greatly simplified discussion by a clear alternative : Tacitus either
wrote the Dialoqae before tlte reiqn of Domitian or he did ‘not write
it at agg-29 Accordingly, the opponents of the Tacitean authorship
directed their main efforts to prove that the Dialogue could not
have been written in the reign of Titus, for the makeshift that the
composition and the publication were not virtually coincident
was justly rejected as intrinsically improbable. The arguments
adduced in support of a later date have been best formulated and

most persistently advocated by G. Andresen. It will, therefore, be

2⁸ This opinion is actually advanced, though still cautiously‚ by Steiner p. 24
and stoutly advocated by Jansen p. 26. Both were doubtless influenced by
Nipperdey's assei-tion that the Dialogus cannot have been written before the
death of the interlocutors, and as Nipperdey and many others believed Maternus
to be identical with the sophist of that name, executed in 91, and that Messalla
is the same as the consul of the year 115, the motive which prompted the above
mentioned advocates of Tacitean authorship to take the position they did, is
very transparent. We shall see that, even supposing Nipperdey's contention to
be valid, there is no obstacle in the way of regarding all the interlocutors as no
longer living in 81 A. D.

2⁹ Of modern critics‚ Huebner, Nipperdey, Wutk, UrIIchs and Schanz still
believe so late a date to be perfectly compatible with Tacitean authorship. The
last named styles our treatise “eine mit Bewusstsein vollzogene kunstlerische
That'' (p. 361). Ι confess that this phrase conveys no meaning to me. Or ⁵
does Schanz imagine that the consul Tacitus, the author of the Agricola and
Germania, whose Histories were to appear a few years later, suddenly about
99 A. ι). at the age of 45 and four years after the publication of Quintilian's
great work, took it into his head to write a rhetorical treatise‚ couched in
Ciceronian phraseology which lie culled directlyfrom Cicero’s writings? This
seems to me psychologically improbable. Non eadem erat aetas, non mens.
