fluouS. —potentia ac potestate: Potentia (δύναμις) designates power³
as such, potestas (ἐξουσία) the power to exercise authority by virtue
of some office, but this differenee is not invariably obser-ved. Cp.
Tegge, Stud. z. latein. Sywnymilc, Berlin 1886 p. 272 Heraeus ad
H. Ι 1, 1. Schmidt, Handb. d. Syn. p. 360 unsuccessfully en-
deavors to establish a metaphysical distinction. — On the allitera-
tion, see Proleg. p. cxvii.

24 rebus prospere fluentibus: Cf. Ann. XV 5 nec praesentia pro-
spere fluebant Cic. de off. I 26, 90 in rebus prosperis . . fluentibus.
Sall. Fragm. 70 rebus supra vota fluentibus (imitated by Tac. H.
IV 48 Iust. 23, 3).

25 aliorum: Subjective genit. with perfugio, objective with tu-
tela. ——-¹vis et utilitas ' belong closely together ³ beneficent power,’
as is shown by the sing. predicate.

26 increpuit: Danger is supposed to emit a noise of warning as ⁴
it approaches. A bold figure and not quite paralleled by the pas-
sages usually quoted from Cic. Cat. Ι 7, 18 quidquid increpuerit
Catilinam timeri. pro Mur. 10, 22 simul atque increpuit suspicio
tumultus and Livy IV 43 VI 37 XLIV 41. The perf. ind. (cod. D
increpuerit) like G. 10. 39 Η. ΙΙ 76 Ann. IV 33. Cp. Klintberg‚
p. 27.

27 reo et periclitanti=reo in periculo eloquentia )( lorica et
gladius [militi] in acie. The adjective ‘periclitanti' is, therefore,
not a superfluous addition but is necessary to bring out the anti-
thesis. Translate: ³ To the accused in a court of law' Andr-esen
regarding the expression as tautological, as do the rest of commen-
tators, says that we expect ³ in foro‚' but that this is not tlie intended
contrast to ‘in acie‚' is clearly shown by the words ‘ sive in iudicio . .
in senatu . . apud principem.'

Vahlen's very simple emendation [quae est] praesidium admirably re-
stores the force and symmetry of the simile which, if not destroyed, is
decidedly weakened by the addition of praesidium . . telum, as a mere
apposition of eloquentia.

28 pariter et: The classical qpariter ac' also occurs a few times in
Tacitus e. g. c. 39 15 Ag. 11 G. 19 Η. IV 73 Ann. IV 50. See also
note c. 5 14. —- sive - · vel ο . sive: On the use of ‘sive,' see the
exhaustive treatise of C. F. W. Muller, Progr. Ioachimsthal. Gymn.
Berlin 1871 and note to c. 4 6.

The MSS. read vel-sive-sive‚ an unparalleled coz-relation. The suggestion
of Muretus, so generally accepted, leaves the origin of the corruption un-
