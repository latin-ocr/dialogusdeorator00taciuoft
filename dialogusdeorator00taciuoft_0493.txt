32 27. -Demosthenem orationes inlustrant quas adversus tutores
composuit: Demosthenes began his suit against his guardians
(Aphobus, Demophon, and Therippides) in 363 Β. 6., at the age of
twenty-one. He obtained a verdict against them, but eventually
secured but a small amount of his patrimony. Of these so-called
ἐπιτροπικοὶ λόγοι, five speeches, partly supposititious, have come
down to us, viz. κατὰ Ἀφόβου, I. ῙῙ. πρὸς Ἀφοβον ψευδομαρτυριῶν
Φάνῳ, πρὸς Ὀνήτορα ἐξούλης 1. ΙΙ. The ill-success of these early
attempts of the orator is sneeringly alluded to by Aesch„ Ctesiph.
173 τὰ πατρῷα καταγελάστως προέμενος. Cp. also Plut. Dem. c. 6.—
Secundus probably spoke of some of the more famous speeches of
Demosthenes, in the portion now lost, so that it was not necessary
to complete the antithesis here, the more so, as he was chiefly
intent on illustrating his argument by Roman examples.—Peter
remarks that ‘composuit' not ‘habuit' is used, because the speaker
has in mind the extant written speeches and the reputation which
they even at the present day possess, but in that case we should
also expect ‘circumdant' in place of ‘circumdederunt' —On the
ellipsis of the demonstrative pronoun (eas), cf. note c. 32 8.
