neuter, not masc. (sc. oratoribus), as Peter contends, for (1) the
so-called in ‘de scriptore' does not occur elsewhere in Tacitus.
(2) Even if it did, consistent usage would here require ‘apud,’ inas-
much as Aper does not include the entire works of the ancient
orators in his otherwise sweeping condemnation, but expressly
exempts some of the speeches of Calvus. Cp. note c. 9 6.

2 risum· --somnum tenere: Of. Cic. Brut. 85, 293 equidem in
quibusdam risum vix tenebam. (Here quibusdam is also neuter
and refers to Cicero's exaggerated estimates of some of the old
Roman orators, such as Cato) 80, 278 tantum abfuit ut inflam-
mares nostros animos, somnum isto loco vix tenebamus. Hor. A. P.
104 male si mandata loqueris aut dormitabo aut ridebo. Our
passage is a clear reminiscence of the Ciceronian phrases, which
also show that ³ tenere' is not, as earlier editors erroneously main-
tained, joined by zeugma to ‘somnums

3 nec unum de populo etc: The meaning of this deplorably muti-
lated passage seems clear. Aper boldly declares that his censure is
not meantto apply merely to obscure third or fourth—class orators,
whose desiccated style nevertheless found supporters, but to the
mOSb eminent as well. Unum de populo, like τῶν ἐκ τοῦ πολλοῦ δήμου
εἷς (Lucian, Somn. 9), is equivalent to what Cicero in the Brutus
(quoted below) in much stronger language called the dregs of
eloquence. What little we know of the orators here presumably
stigmatised, for the names themselves are corrupted, has been
collected and exhaustively discussed by Nipperdey, Rh. fisus. XIX
559-—568 (= Opusc. 302 ff.)‚ from whom the following data are
taken. Canutius is undoubtedly identical with P. Canutius frc-
