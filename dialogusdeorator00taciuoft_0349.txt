c. 18.‘ 205

vatus (pro Sest. 10, 24 enervati atque exsangues), exibis, ieiunus
(Sen. Ep. 75, 3 11011. ,ieiuna et arida volo), concisum, minutum
(de orat. II 38,159 III 18, 66), siccus (Quint XI 1, 32), opposed
to vis, virilis, lacerti, nervi, sucus. See below.

The passages just cited, and the remarkable general agreement between
Tacitus and Quintilian, pointing unmistakably to a common source, ought
to leave no doubt that ⁶ exsanguem et aridum ' represents the genuine read-
ing. The examples usually adduced from Quintilian in support of ⁶ attritus,’
e. g. X 1, 27 attrita cotidiano actu forensi ingenia 4, 4 sit ergo aliquando
quod placeat . . . ut opus poliat, non exterat, seem to have little, if any-
thing, in common with the passage under notice, and are in any case not

sufficient to offset the convincing evidence in favor of the repeatedly-occur-
ring collocation in the text. Cp. also Peter ad loc.

24 otiosum: ‘tedious, dull, monotonous,' 0. 22 12 otiosus circa
excessus ³ wordy.' Often synonymous with ³ supinus, lentus, tardus)
Peterson, to Quint. X 1, 27, renders the word in both passages by
‘ wearisome, spiritless,' but it is not likely that Cicero and Brutus
accused each other of the identical fault. See below, ‘Otiosum'
is used in particular reference, it would seem, to the philosophie
discursiveness of Brutus, while in 0. 22 it pertains to Cicero’s lack

v of succinctness and conciseness of expression. Cf. Stat. Silv. IV

9, 20 Bruti senis oscitationes and Quint. X 2, 17 tristes ac ieiuni
Pollionem aemulantur, otiosi ac supini, si quid modo longius cir-
cumduxerunt, iurant ita Ciceronem locuturum fuisse. —diiunctum:
'disjointed' Sandys in his excellent account of Brutus in Cic.
Orat. p.1.vn1 thinks this epithet refers to ³ the absence of a flowing
and harmonious rhythm.' I ain rather inclined to understand it
of the epigrammatic and laconic style which Brutus, according to
Plut. Brut. 2, affected in his Greek writings, for of his Latin diction
the biographer expresses no opinion, being no competent critic
(Cf. Life of Dem. 2) ε Ῥωμαϊστὶ μὲν οὖν ἤσκητο πρὸς τὰς διεξόδους καὶ
τοὺς ἀγῶνας ἱκανῶς ὃ Βροῦτος Ἑλληνιστὶ δὲ τὴν ἀποφθεγματικὴν καὶ
Λακωνικὴν ἐπιτηδεύων βραχυλογίαν ἐν ταῖς ἐπιστολαῖς ἐνιαχοῦ παράσημός
ἐστιν. This view seems confirmed by the use of ‘fractum,’ which,
like ‘dissolutus, dissipatus,' would be synonymous with ‘diiunc-
tum.' All is perfectly clear, if we refer Cicero's strictures, more
particularly to the matter, those of Brutus to the style. Cp. note
c. 26 3 f. diiunctum and aridus, like ‘elaboratus' (l. 12), are not
yet used by Cicero of persons. —rursusque= ‘On the other hand,'
αὖ, is common in Tac. e. g. Ag. 29 H. III 52 IV 14 V 4 Ann. I
12. 80 II 39 XI 28 XIII 13. 14.
