exercises designated by the elder Seneca as domesticae (Contr.
·I praef. 12, III praef. 1) or secretae (ibid. VII praef. 1.). From
Contr. IV praef. 2 ι Pollio Asinius numquam admissa multitudine
declamavit, it also appears that arcana semotae dictionis are op-
posed to public recitations. It seems, therefore, more than doubt—
ful whether ‘arcana' can properly be identified with the exercises
alluded to in c. 14 17 as declamatorium studium, as is contended
by some. See note ad loc—On the use of neuter adjectives as
nouns and as such joined with genitives, a construction more

Nipperdey's assertion (Ann. III 1), retained in the last edition
(1892), that plerique and plerumque in Tacitus always signify
'very many, very often' is not confirmed by the LeX. Tac., for
out of a total of 162 instances (omitting 10 doubtful cases), the
superlative meaning occurs 48 times. In the Dial. c. 26 10
