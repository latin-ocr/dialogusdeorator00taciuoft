14 quasi rursus incipiens: Doubtless also a Ciceronian reminis-
cence. Cf. Brut. 55, 201 Cum haec disseruissem uterque assensus
est. et ego tamquam de intem-0 ordiens, quanda —initia et semina:
Of. Cic. Tusc. Disp. V 24, 69 inde est. indagatio initiorum et tam-
quam seminum Quint. ΙΙ 20, 6 initia quaedam ac semina sunt con-
cessa natura. On the omission of an apologetic particle, see note
c. 5 23.

15 docendo: On the modal abl. of the gerund, see note c. 11 6.

16 institui erudirique: Combined also in Cic. Verr. II 3, 69, 161
eos (sc. liberos) instituere atque erudire ad maiorum instituta . . .
debuisti.

17 quamquam ‘of course.' On this use of ‘quamquam' at the
beginning of a sentence, cf. note c. 28 8.—ipsis artibus inest:
Tacitus invariably construes ‘inesse' with a dative in his later
writings, and so generally in Silver Latin3 Cicero, on the other
hand, always has a preposition, with the single exception of de off.
Ι 42, 151 quibus autem artibus . . . prudentia maior inest. Cp. Dr.
Η. S. I 416. But the ‘m’ of quamquam immediately preceding
may possibly have caused the omission of ‘in,' so that T. would
be here still following Ciceronian usage, as in c. 11 15 and 30 4,
where see notes

The numerous variants in our MSS. seem to me due to the fact that
‘varias,' having been accidentally omitted, was placed above the line and
on being reintroduced into the text caused the confusion now existing.
As ⁴ varias ' is more closely allied to ‘tot ’ than ‘reconditas' I have had no
hesitation in accepting J ohn's transposition (Fleck. Jahrb. 1888 p. 574), but
I now prefer to read ‘ ac ’ for ⁶ aut,' for ‘varias' and ⁴ reconditas’ consti-
tute no logical alternative but are simply enumerative. ‘So many, so
various and abstruse subjects.' ‘Ac was either confused with ‘aut' (cf.
crit. note 31 5) or omitted after ⁴ varias' (-acac) as an apparent dittography.
——With the asyndeton, cf. e. g. Liv. V 54, 5 tot tam valida oppida XXV
37, 13 tot tam inopinata and Dr. H. S. II 12 f.

19 nisi ut—-nisi ita ut. So Quint. V 10, 57 Plin. II 11, 16 Suet.
Claud. 35. In Tac. perhaps in but one other passage: Ann. IV 38

The ancients generally regarded three things as essential to com·

subdivided into (a) meditatio μεμελετημένος λόγος ‘theoretical exer-
