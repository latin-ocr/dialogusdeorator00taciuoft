Π 12, 38 verbi (verborum) controversia—tamquam, introduces
the opinion of another, as iu c 2 2, where see note.

4 centum annos: Messalla curtly dismisses Aper's chronological
argument as irrelevant and is hence free to use a round number,
even though it may seem to favor his opponent's contention, by
still further narrowing down the short interval that has elapsed
between the so called ³ antiqui ' and his own time.

5 de vocabulo pugna: Similar military metaphors are frequent.
Cf. e. g. Cic. de fin. II 13, 42 Stoicis quibuscum bellum gerebat
(sc. Carneades) de div. II 51, 105 Quint. X 1, 105 quantam mihi
concitem pugnam.

6 quo alio nomine: e. g. veteres, prisci, olim nati—dum modo
occurs in Tacitus only here and G. 6, ‘dum' taking its place in his
other writings.

7 in confesso: The same expression occurs c. 27 3 and frequently
elsewhere (see Dict). On these and similar ‚prepositional phrases,
cp. Dr. H. S. 1 55-59 Stil p. 36 Gerber De usu praep. p. 11.—
eminentiorem, used figuratively as in c. 1 2.

8 parti ‘passage.'—si cominus fatetur: This much disputed
passage seems to me perfectly intelligible and unobjectionable in
expression. Si for the more regular ‘qua' is sufficiently supported
by the many parallel constructions adduced by Vahlen, Prooem.

cio . . . cruciat, si opinamur ΠΙ 31, 76 detrahere illam opinionem
maerenti, si se officio fungi putet. cominus, in keeping with the
military metaphors immediately preceding, is somewhat boldly
but appropriately here used of coming closer to the main point at
issue which Aper did, when he made the remark (c. 18 7 f.) which
Messalla approvingly repeats, for the discussion which preceded
was, in the speaker's opinion, as we have seen, not germane to the
subject. On a perfectly analogous use of ‘cominus,' cf. Cic. de
div. II 10, 26 sed haec fuerit nobis tamquam levis armaturae prima
orationis excursio. nunc cominus agamus. —fatetur = profitetur.
Common in all periods of the language‚ in Tac. again c. 17 17 Ann.
I 13 II 13. See also note c. 1 18.—There is, as Andresen well
observes, a touch of sarcasm in these words, implying that Aper
had, with some flourish, adduced as an original discovery what was
after all but a well-recognised truth.

The interpretation just given seems to me perfectly suited to the context,
and as it involves no arbitrary or violent changeS, 1 cannot but regard the
