and is found in the indelible impress made upon the mind of
Tacitus by the horrors of the reign of Domitian, for according to
Buffon's famous phrase, “le style est de l'homme meme,'' and so
Goethe says ‘³ Im Ganzen ist der Stil eines Schriftstellers ein
treuer Abdruck seines Inneren.” But if the man Tacitus neces-
sarily revealed himself in the stylist Tacitus, it was as natural that
the buoyant optimism of his youth should revel in the exuberance
of diction which characterises the Dialogue, as that a brief, suc-
cinet, nervous, and energetic style should become the fit vehicle of
expression for the feelings of intense indignation which had taken
possession of Tacitus when, after the death of Domitian, he deter-
mined to devote himself to historical composition.

Inflyaence of Still another reason for the change under discussion is the differ-

Wbffect'maaer' enee of the subject-matter itself. A speech, a history, a dialogue or
a letter call for distinctly different stylistic treatment, at least in
the hands of an ancient writer, for Latin, as well as Greek, though
perhaps in an inferior degree, by reason of an incomparable flex-
ibility of structure and elasticity of form, can be made to reproduce,
like a musical instrument, characteristic features of thought and
feeling. In fact, it is only in music that we can find a modern
analogue to this unrivaled versatility of expression of Greek and
Latin, modern languages being far more rigid, less plastic and more
devoid of stylistic freedom. Hence we find the various species of
literary composition in the classic tongues conforming to particular
types or genera dicendi peculiarly adapted to the thought which
they are designed to embody,1⁰⁰ and the numerous ancient systems
of rhetoric, which to modern notions seem so often only the result

laetum, numerosum et aequabile dicendi genus, quo iuvenis viguerat, sicut con-
tinuis imbribus vexata et prostrata seges non ad priorem integrum laetumque
florem resurgit, cum praesertim uberes iam et frequentes spicas conceperit.
Animo eius concusso, ex acerbato, indignato talis sermo non amplius conveni-
ebat; uti potuit oratione non fere alia, quam qua usus est, brevi et nervosa,
interdum aspera et acerba. Sive igitur Taciti in scribendo consilium sive animi
eius immutationem respicimus, saevo Domitiani imperio effectam facere eum
non potuisse videmus, quin in historicis suis scriptis componendis uteretur
sermone a dialogi stilo prorsus alieno.

1⁰⁶ It is this mechanical element which alone explains the successful perpetra-
tion in antiquity of such literary frauds as that of Anaximenes’ Τρικάρανος or
the numerous apocryphal writings of Lysias, Demosthenes, eto„ no less than the
stylistic parodies of Plato. See Classical Studies in Honor of Henry Drisler
