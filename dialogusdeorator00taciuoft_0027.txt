PROLEGOMENA. xxiii

difficulties on the other exclude the possibility of Tacitean author-
ship. It will be expedient to take up the latter objection first, but
to answer it successfully, it will be necessary above all to ascertain‚
if possible, the dramatic date of the Dialogue and the date of
publication.¹⁰

P.²⁰ Cornelius Tacitus was probably born not earlier than 54 and
not later than 56 A. D.²¹

Now in c. 17 10 ff, Aper, the champion of the modern style of
eloquence‚ in order to prove the purely relative meaning of the
term ‘ antiqui' and the consequent injustice of its persistent appli-
cation to the orators of the Roman Republic‚ draws the attention
of his hearers to the fact that the interval that has elapsed between
the death of Cicero and-the present day does not exceed the limit
of a man's life-time. To substantiate this assertion he gives an
annalistic enumeration of the reigns of the Roman emperors from
Augustus down to Vespasian. (Statue sex et quinquaginta annos
quibus mox divus Augustus rem publicam rexit . . . ac sextam iam
felicis huius principatus stationem ²² quo Vespasianus rem publicam

²⁹ Some critics, like Lange and Urlichs for instance, in order to avoid certain
objections to which they attached undue weight, suggested that possibly a long
interval had elapsed between the composition and the publication of the treatise.
But this hypothesis is worthless and uncalled for ; worthless, because it involves
the gratuitous assumption that Tacitus was prevented from publishing the
treatise in the reign of Titus, and if so, that he issued this work of his youth in
the reign of TraJ'an‚ when wholly occupied with historical composition. It is
uncalled for, because the difficulties which gave it birth, do not exist, as we

' shall see.

2³ The praenomen Publius, given by the cod. Mediceus‚ has been recently
confirmed by a Carian inscription (Bull. de Corresp. Heli. 1890 p. 621) Ἀσιανοὶ
Ἰωκς”Ανθυ[πά.τῳ] Πο. Κορν[ηλίῳ] Τακίτῳ. Apoll. Sidon. Ep. IV 14. 22 calls him
twice Gaius, but the C., found also in a few MSS„ was probably originally due
to a dittography of the initial letter of the nomen gentile.

²1 In the famous and much disputed passage at the beginning of the Histories
(Ι 1) : dignitatem nostram a Vespasiano (69-79) incohatam, a Tito (79-81)
auctam, a Domitiano (81-96) longius provectam non abnuerim, diynz'tatem . . .
auctam is the technical designation for the quaestorship (Borghesi,Urlichs)‚ and
if Tacitus was appointed to this office by Titus ‘ suo anno,' he was twenty-five
years old and therefore born 54, 55 or 56. In the present discussion, it will be
apedient to assume the earliest date with Nipperdey, for by making this con-
cession the chronological objections will be emphasised as strongly as possible,
and their subsequent refutation accordingly the more convincing.

2² On statio which has also created unnecessary difficulty, see note ad loc.
The peculiar meaning which the word has here, is perhaps a Gallicism.
