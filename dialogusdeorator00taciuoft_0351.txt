his libellous attacks, he was banished to the desert island of
Seriphos by Tiberius, where he died in most abject poverty in
32 A. 1). Of. Tac. Ann. 1 7 2 IV 21. The frequent allusions to him
in Seneca Rhetor, Tacitus, and Quintilian bear ample testimony
to the enduring impression which his eloquence made, and justify‚
in a partial measure, the great importance which Aper and even
Messalla (c. 26, where see notes) attach to him. Cp. Teuffel, §t 267,
11 and esp. P. Robert‚ De Cassii Severi eloquentia, Paris 1890,
pp. 83. Cassius Severus occupies the same position in the devel-
opment of Roman eloquence that Demetrius Phalereus does among
the Greeks. Cp. note c. 14 14.

The opening paragraph οι· this chapter is beset with very great difficulties, =

owing to a corruption and lacuna in the text, which scholare have with
but indifferent success attempted to solve (see p. 23). The insertion of
‘ Severum’ after Cassium is an evident emendation, for the orator is every-
where cited with his full name, with but three exceptions in Quint. (VI
1, 43 X 1, 22 XII, 10, 11), where the context, however, precludes the
possibility of a misunderstanding. ‘Qui usque' points unmistakably to a
lacuna. Vahlen’s and John's restorations give, it must be admitted, a very
satisfactory sense, and at the same time account for the origin of the cor-
ruption, but the emendation of the former, as John points out, involves the
necessity of referring ⁴ qui ’ to the distant antecedent ⁴ admiratores,'—in my
judgment a fatal objection. To obviate this difficulty, it has been suggested
to take ‘hunc' as the personal pronoun referring to Cassius Severus, but
this seems improbable, because the relative ‘ qui’ clause would in that case
be out of place. John, therefore, substitutes ‘ut' for ‘qui,’ which is too
bold a change. The possibility of a proper interpretation of ‘ reum faciunt,'
which bears all the marks of genuineness, appears to have been lost with
the missing words in the lacuna. Michaelis, followed by Peter, Wolff and
Andresen, takes ‘quatenus . . . solent’ as a parenthesis, and omits ‘qui
usque ad' and ‘quem reum faciunt,' an emendation without a shadow of
intrinsic probability. The difficulties seem to me to be insuperable, without
the accession of new MS. material. Cp. on the whole question Vahlen,
Prooem. Berl. 1878-9, p. 13 f., and the detailed discussion of John, C'or-

Dis-ecta admits of no satisfactory explanation. In the present context,
it could only designate a mode of speaking that makes straight for the point
at issue, indulging in no irrelevant episodes3 but this is precisely the charac-
teristic feature of the modern style of eloquence, as Aper proceeds to point
out. Cf. below 1. 9 impeditissimarum . . . eximeret 25 expectandum . . .

their replies. Cf. c. 32 17 ff. 38 3 ff. When, therefore, Aper is made in
