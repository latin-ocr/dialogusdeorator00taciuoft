34 ineptiis meis plausisse: ‘foolish hobbies.⁷ On the various
meanings of ‘ineptiae,' see e. g. Cic. de orat. I 24, 111 ‘indiscre-
tions' ΙΙ 4, 18 ²f011y⁷ ΙΙΙ 49, 187 ‘want of taste' Catull. XIVb
Mart. ΙΙ 86, 9 XI 1, 13 = nugae Plin. IV 14, 8 longa praefatione
vel excusare vel commendare ineptias (i. e. de suis hendecasyllabis)
ineptissimum est. Neither ‘ineptiae' 1101· the adj. ‘ineptus ² occurs
elsewhere in Tacitus—With this closing remark, cp. Cassius ap.
Tac. Ann. XIV 43 ne nimio amore antiqui moris studium meum
extollere viderer.

Ch. 33-36. Maternus draws attention to the manzfest incompleto-
ness of Messalla's treatment of the subject, and requests him to supple-
ment it by qivinq also an account of the manner in which the youth
of the period, after completinq their theoretical education, acquired a
thorouqh practical traininq, a requirement equally essential to a suc-
cessful oratorical career (— c. 33 12). Messalla complies by showing]
that such forensic eaeperience was qained by constant personal attend-
ance in the law-courts themselves and by actual association with the
most renowned speakers of the day (— c. 34). This inspirinq and
instructive method is thereupon contrasted with the modern pernicious
practice of moot-courts, conducted within the walls of the school-rooms
of qood-for-nothinq rhetoricians and dealinq with fictitious, qrotesque
and farfetched themeS. Thus brouyht up in a purely artzflcicd
atmosphere, the youth of the day are helpleSS, when called upon
to take part in real forensic or judicial encounters (— c. 35). The
close of the speech is lost.

33. 2 peregisse· - - incohasse: The same antithesis occurs in
Quint. VI 4, 1 altercationis praecepta poterant videri tunc inco-
handa cum omnia . . . peregissem.

3 vestigia ac liniamenta: A double metaphor. Vestiqia occurs ·
a number of times in a figurative sense in Tacitus e. g. Ag. 16 ⁵
quorum vestigiis et studiis vitam duxerit 2 patris . . . vestigia
premere, but ³ liniamenta,⁷ though common in Cicero (Orat. 56, 186
Brut. 87, 298), is used in but one other passage in Tac. and then in
its regular meaning of ‘outlinesf G. 16 picturam et liniamenta
colorum imitetur. -Peter well observes that ³ ostendisse ² in place
of ‘tradidisse’ still further emphasises the incompleteness of
Messalla's previous exposition. Cf. Ag. 13 divus Iulius . . . potest
videri ostendisse posteris non tradidisse (sc. Britanniam).—On
the repetition ³ videris . . . videaris.' See note c. 1 8.
