numerous emendations proposed as an unnecessary tampering with the
text. Cp. Andresen, Emend. p. 148-150 John, correspbl. p. 29 f.—10h.
Muller, followed by Wolff and Andresen‚ ingeniously conjectured ‘qua
quasi cominus nisus' on the analogy of Tac. Ann. IV 51 adversum resi-
stentis cominus niti fatetur. But ⁴ qua '- for ‘si' is not called for, as has

“''been shown, noris ‘quasi' needed, for Tacitus and other post-Augustam
Writers freely dispense with apologies for unusual metaphors. See E.
Wolff, Einlez't. p. 14 f. ‘nisus' is also superfluous, for I cannot see why
⁶ cominus' may not have the meaning which was given to it above. Finally,
it is intrinsically improbable that three words were omitted in the MSS.
Nissen's easy emendation ‘ eomminans,' revived by Vahlen, is, in my judg-
ment out of place, as 1 am unable to recognise any thr-eat in the words of
Aper in c. 18 7 agere enirn fortius iam et audentius volo.

9 plures=complures. The only instance of this confusion in
the Dialogus, though exceedingly common in the other writings of
Tacitus. See Lex. Tac. p. 88212-8832. It seems to occur first in
the Bell. Afric. Cp. Archiv, VI 91 and in general, Schmalz, Antib.

10 primae sc. partes. A very frequent ellipsis (see Dict.); in
Tac. also Ann. XIV 21 eloquentiae primas nemo tulit. With ‘tri-
buere' e. g. Cic. Orat. 5, 18 cui vel primas eloquentiae patrum.
nostrorum tribuebat aetas 17, 56.—De1nosthenes and Cicero are
habitually grouped together as marking the zenith of oratical great-
ness in antiquity. Cp. the beautiful antithesis in‘ Hieron. ad
Nepot. de vita cleric. : Demosthenes tibi (sc. Ciceroni) praeripuit,
¹ ne esses primus orator ; tu illi ne solus. — Aeschines et Hyperides
et Lysias et Lycurgus: The names of the Greek, as well as those
of the Roman orators, enumerated immediately below, are not
arranged chronologically, but in the order of merit. Quint. X 1, 7 6
agrees with this critical estimate : Decem (sc. oratores) simul Athe-
nis aetas una tulit quorum longe princeps Demosthenes . . . Aesch.
Hyp. . . . Lysias. The coincidence has been thought highly signi-
ficant. It ceases to be so, when we observe that Quintilian pro-
ceeds to discuss Isocrates, while Lycurgus is never so much as even
mentioned throughout the entire Institutio.

The editors of the Dial. have with singular unanimity rejected ‘ autem'
before ‘locum' lt is, however, eminently proper in this place, as shown
by the succeeding symmetrically constructed clause: Cicero . . . Calvus
autem. It is the second ‘autem ' that ought to have been objected to, and
Ι feel convinced that the original reading was ‘tamen' The corruption
was either due to the false solution of an illegible compendium, or to meta-
