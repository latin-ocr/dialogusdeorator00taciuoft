simis audientibus. From these and numerous other passages in
Quint. and Seneca, it follows that Andresen, John, Wolff and others
are wrong in identifying ‘declamatorium studium' with ‘arcana
semotae dictionis’ in c. 2. For in that case, we should also expect
the phrase to have been transferred to the ³ sed etiam ⁷ clause, since
‘non forensibus tantum negotiis (real cases) et decl. stud.' (extra
judicial pleadings) are clearly contrasted with the ‘ disputatio' of
Aper and Maternus, interrupted by the entrance of Messalla. —
non · · - tantum is, in Tac. , with but two exceptions, always separated
by an intervening word. Cf. c. 22 17 Ag. 45 G. 35 H. I 15. 35 Ann.
III 33 XV 45 XVI 2 and XIII 20 non tantum matrem Plautumque
XIV 55 qui me non tantum praevisa sed subita, where rhetorical
reasons may have caused the irregular collocation. Cp. notes c.
2 6 and 7 13.

18 ingenium alunt: A Ciceronian phrase. Cf. Brut. 33, 126
alere ing. potest ex Cic. Ep. apud Suet. de cl. rhet. 2 ε existimabant
Graecis exercitationibus ali melius ingenia posse Quint. I 8, 8 II
5, 18 VIII pr. 2 XII 6, 6 and c. 33 9.

19 litterarum iucundissimum etc: On the ὁμοιόπτωτον, see note
c. 5 6.—cum-tum: See c. 5 6.

20 pervenerint: The subjunctive in a conditional relative clause
expressing repeated action occasionally occurs in Cicero, but always
in the perfect as here. The subj. preterite in such constructions is
not found before the time of Livy. Cp. Dr. H. S. ΙΙ 540 f. Stil
p. 66 Madvig L. G. ἓ 359, FurneauX, Ann. Introd. I p. 47. — The
inconcinnity observable in the interchange of moods (qui . . .
adferunt' and ‘ad quorum . . . pervenerint ⁷) is quite characteristic
of Tacitus. Cf. Ann. I 44 adprobaverat . . . obiectavissent VI 18
habuisset . . . tribuerat, where see Nipp. and Furneaux. The refer-
ence is, of course, to outsiders, as in c. 32 31 quos si forte audierint,
but John unaccountably cites this passage in support of the very
opposite interpretation ! These phrases, it may be observed‚ unmis-
takably indicate that the Dialogus is not the faithful reproduction
of an actual debate, as alleged, although it may possibly, like the
similar works of Cicero, be ultimately based upon some historical
occurrence. See Prolegomena p. lxxx note 179.

21 itaque: In Tac. only here and c. 30 19 39 23. —Post-positive
first in Rhet. ad Heren. I 18, never in Cicero, but quite common in
Livy and later writers. Cp. R. V. III p. 293 f. Neue, Formenl.
11³ p. 976.
