322 — NOTES.

18 ita not = ‘ itaque,' as the Lex. Tac. erroneously takes it. See
below—optimus quidem=optimus ille quidem. Cf. note 6. 3 8
and crit. note c. 32 30.

19 faciem - ·- non imaginem: i. e1. the real countenance not a
mere counterfeit. Cf. Cic. Orat. 3, 9 perfectae eloquentiae speciem
animo videmus, effigiem auribus quaerimus Tusc. Disp. ΙΙΙ 2, 3
consectaturque nullam eminentem effigiem virtutis, sed adumbra-
tam imaginem gloriae Quint. X 2, 11 necesse est minus sit eo
quod imitatur, ut umbra corpore et imago facie Apul. Met. 10, 27
mulier . . . supprimens faciem, praetendens imaginem.

20 rudibus: rudis is a soil or perhaps a wooden stick used in
fencing exercises. In a figurative sense also in Cic. de opt. gen. 6,
17 non enim in acie versatur (sc. Isocrates) et ferro sed quasi
rudibus eius eludit oratio. Tacitus, as often, omits the apologetic
particle.

⁴ sed,’ the reading of our MSS. is unintelligible and probably arose out
of the wrong solution of a compendium. ‘Sic,' followed by ‘ ut,' is cor-
related to ‘ita' above. ‘ In this way, there lacked not— thus it was that.’
An original ‘nec ' would scarcely have been corrupted into ⁴ sed.'

21 auditorium · -· ex invidis et faventibus: The prepositional
phrase, denoting the material out of which an audience is com-
posed, is here joined as an attributive directly to the substantive.
Of. e. g. Tac. H. IV 76 nullas esse Ceriali nisi e reliquiis Germanici
exercitus legiones Cic. in Verr. Π 4, 27, 62 pocula ex auro Liv.
I 34 ex virtute nobilitas, and so often with other prepositions as
‘a, de, sine.' Usually, however, some verb such as ‘compositus,
mixtus, constitutus' is added. E. g. Tac. H. IV 37 mixtus ex
Chattis Usipis Mattiacis exercitus 79 (cohors) ex Chaucis Frisiis-
que composita. The present instance is particularly noteworthy‚
because the prepositional clause is added as an attributive adJ'ec-
tive, a collocation apparently found only with ¹ sine,' on which see

note c. 32 21.

‘ Semper novum' is, in my judgment, an interpolation, for this epithet
was, 01 course, quite as applicable to the audiences of the speaker's own
day as to those of the Republic. Hence the phrase has no place in the
present context, which deals only with points of differ-enee between the two
periods. This suspicion derives strong external support from the fact that
the MS. variants (p. 45) also unmistakably point to a supralinear gloss
which subsequently intruded into the text in different places.

22 1166 bene nec male dicta dissimularentur: With ‘nec bene,'
understand in thought ¹ simularentur ⁷ i. e. the praiseworthy utter-
