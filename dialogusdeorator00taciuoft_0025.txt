serious obstacle to those who denied the genuineness of the
Dialogus, and accordingly we are not surprised to find that Lipsius
was bent upon impugning the validity of the evidence rosels, his
contentiori being that the name might have been added to the
treatise,handed down to us ἀδέσποτον, by accident or design. When
it became known that a far greater number of MSS. of the Dialogus
existed than Lipsius had supposed, it was claimed that his inference
still held good, inasmuch as these MSS. were not so many inde-
pendent witnesses but were all ultimately derived from a sinqle
copy, not older than the middle of the XIII. century.¹⁵ Taking this
very questionable fact in connection with the observation (Ξ) that
the Dialogus invariably occupies the last place in a codex miscel-
laneus containing also the Suetonius fragment and Tacitus'
Germania, Hess and Haase confident-,ly argued that the presumably
anonymous treatise owed the name of Tacitus to the Germania
immediately preceding it.¹⁶ Unfortunately, the order of the three
treatises in our MSS. irrefutably disproves this very premise¹⁷ and
with it the inference based upon it, for the Germania precedes the

scholare such as Sabellicus and Peutinger and editor of Terence, Sallust, Varro,
Livy, Pliny the Younger, and Quintilian, quoted a passage from the Dialogus of
Tacitus (c. 26 3). -This seemed such strong testimony in favor of the historian
that Lipsius, as we have seen, wishing to get rid of this awkward evidence at all
hazards, stultified himself by accusing Sabinus, whom he styles iynobz'lis gram-
maticus, of forging the citationi Gutmann reiterated the same absurd charge
and Fr. Hess p. 16 actually censured the learned Italian for attributing the phrase
‘calamistros Maecenatis’ to Tacitus, whereas it is in reality used by Messalla 1
. The citation of course proves nothing except the well-known fact that no sus-
picion was entertained regarding the Tacitean authorship of the Dialogus before

· the time of Rhenanus. Sabinus may easily have obtained his information from

some of the printed editions published during his life-time or even from some
MS. He is known to have copied the Agricola with his own hand. Cp.

genere servatus esse videtur, nisi in quo is Germaniae Taciti subiunctus esset, ut
facile potuerit, id quod saepissime factum est, auctoris nomen recte in antece-
