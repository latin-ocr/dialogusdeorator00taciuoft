gilii scripsit (among whom Bavius and Maevius are also mentioned,
cf. Serv. ad Ecl. III 90 VII 21), pauca admodum obiecta ei proponit
eaque circa historiam fere, et quod pleraque ab Homero sumpsisset,
sed hoc ipsum crimen sic defendere assuetum ait: ‘cur non illi
quoque eadem furta temptarent ? verum intellecturos, facilius esse
Herculi clavam quam Homero versum subripere! Cp. Ribbeck,
Proleg. ad Verg. Opera p. 96-113.

24 Asinii aut Messallae liber: O. Asinius Pollio (born 76 Β. c.
cos. 40, triumphed over the Parthians 39, died c. 5 A. n), M. Valerius
Messalla Corvinus <born c. 64 Β. c. cos. 31, triumphed over the Gauls
27, died not later than 8 A. D.), both distinguished as statesmen,
generals, poets, historiams, and orators, and repeatedly grouped
together e. g. by Quint. X 1, 113 (where see Peterson's notes), by
Tacitus, c. 17. 21 Ann. IV 34 XI 6. 7. They are here introduced
only in their capacity as orators, their other literary achievements
being overlooked chiefly because they are contrasted with Lysias and
Hyperides, partly also because their fame as historians and poets,
particularly in Messalla's case, was, in the judgment of later genera-
tions, eclipsed by their oratorical reputation. Liber=oratio edita.
Frequent in Silver Latin, but not in Quintilian. See note c. 3 2.

25 Medea ovidii: Written at the age of 30 (cf. Am. III 1, 29),
and mentioned by the poet himself in Am. II 18, 13 III 1, 11. 67.
Trist. II 553 and perhaps referred to Am. III 15, 18. Probably
used by Seneca (F. Leo, Sen. Trag. I p. 166) and by Maternus.
Cf. Quint. X 1, 98 Ovidii Medea videtur mihi ostendere quantum
ille vir praestare potuerit si ingenio suo imperare quam indulgere
maluisset. Only two lines, quoted by Quint. VIII 8, 56 and Sen.
Suas. III 7 have come down to iis—Varii Thyestes: L. Varius
Rufus (74-14), an older contemporary and friend of Horace and
Virgil, whose Aeneid he, with the aid of Plotius Tucca, prepared
for publication. He is chiefly known as the writer of epic poems
celebrating the exploits of Caesar and Octavianus, and as the author
of the tragedy Thyestes. Cf. the prefatory scholion to the cod.
