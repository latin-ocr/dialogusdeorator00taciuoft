c. 6. 95

3, 211 Pliny, Ep. III 9, 16 Quint. X 2, 3. 28 and VIII 3, 85 (in a
quotation from Cic. pro Ligar. 5, 15, but here our MSS. read quan-
tum). Cp. Dr. H. S. II 521 f.—-ingentium opum - · magnae: In
the later writings, probably under Virgilian influence, Τ. develops
an increasing fondness for the more emphatic forms, such as ingens,
inmensum, inmanis and the like. In the Dial. ³ ingens' occurs again
c. 37 20. Cf. also Ag. 25 magno paratu but H. II 95 ingenti p.
H. I 49 magnae opes but H. III 72 V 8 Ann. XII 22 immensae
opes. H. II 61 viri magni, thereafter regularly viri insignes or
inlustres. See Woelfflin, Philol. XXVII, 124 f. Here both ingens
and magnus are used side by side for the sake of variety.

11 voluptas spectare: Abstract substantives are often used as
the predicates of an infinitive. voluptas c. inf. is found, e. g. in
Prop. I 10, 3 meminisse mihi iucunda voluptas. Ov. Heroid. XII
21 but not elsewhere in prose. Cp. Dr. Η. S. II ἓ 431. On the
substantival infiniffive, cp. Woelfflin, Archiv pp. II 7 0-91.— homines
veteres et senes: homines ‘.people, Germ. Leute.' Cp. Archiv„ VI
340 ff.—‘vetus ' rarely designates time of life as in Livy V 54, 5
Tac. Ann. II 2. 43 VI 31, but it is generally used in the sense of
vetustus, of one who has gained ripe experience by length of service
in the army, for instance. Cf. H. I 23 Ann. XI 25 and hence some
commentators translate veteres et senes ‘ old and experienced men,'
thus doing away with the tautology. The tendency of both Greek
and Romans, however, to group words like veteres, antiqui, prisci
together (cf. note c. 15 1) and expressions, such as we find in Ter.
Eun. IV 4, 21 vietus, vetus veternosus senex and Tibull. I 8, 50 :
in veteres esto dura, puella, senes make it at least doubtful, whether
such distinctions were more than vaguely felt, for the best and most ,
careful writers often use these words without any appreciable differ-
ence of meaning. Peter's interpretation of ‘homines veteres ² as the
counterpart of ‘ homines novi ⁷ is unsupported by actual usage. He
leaves us the alternative of accepting this ἇπ. εῖρ. or of banishing
‘veteres' from the text, but its deletion necessarily draws that of
homines with it 1 How a scribe ever came to hit upon the unfortu-
nate interpolation of veteres, Peter also forgets to tell us. On the
synonymic character of the words, a much disputed question, cp.
Landgraf, Cio. pro Rosc. Am. 17 Mayor ad Iuv. XV 33 and Schmidt,
Handb. der Synonymik p. 479-86.—-t0tius orbis=orbis terrarum is
chiefly poetic (e. g. Ovid) and post-Augustan. In Tac: Ag. 17. 30
