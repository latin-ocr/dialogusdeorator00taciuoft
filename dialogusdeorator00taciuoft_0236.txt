92 · NOTES.

31 disertam quidem=disertam illam quidem, cf. c. 3 8.—inexer-
citatam: Common in Cicero, though not elsewhere in Tacitus, who
uses ¹ inexpertus ' instead.

32 Helvidius Priscus: Cf. Tac. H. IV 5 Helvidius Priscus † ori-
gine Caracina e municipio Cluviano . ’. . ingenium inlustre altiori-
bus studiis iuvenis admodum dedit, non ut plerique quo nominc
magnifico segne otium velaret sed quo firmior adversus fortuita
rem publicam capesseret. Doctores sapientiae (i. e. the Stoics)
secutus est . . . quaestorius adhuc (of Achaia in the reign of Nero)
a Paeto Thrasea gener delectus, e moribus soceri nihil aeque ac
libertatem hausit. . . . cunctis vitae officiis aequabilis, opum con-
temptor, recti pervicax, constans adversus metus. 6 Erant quibus
adpetentior famae videretur, quando etiam sapientibus cupido glo-
riae novissima exuitur, ruina soceri in exilium pulsus (66 A. D.
According to Schol. Iuv. V 36 he betook himself to Apollonia) ut
Galbae principatu (68 A. D.) rediit, Marcellum Eprium delatorem
Thraseae accusare adgreditur (68-69> . . . Primo minax certamen
et eqreqiis utriusque orationibus testatum mox dubia voluntate Gal-
bae multis senatorum deprecantibus omisit Priscus (1). Ceterum
co senatus die quo de imperio Vespasiani censebant, placuerat mitti
ad principem legatos. Hinc (2) inter Helvidium et Eprium acre
iurgium . . . Marcellus urnam postulabat quae consulis designati
sententia fuerat . . 8 Vicit pars quae sortiri legatos malebat. The
discrepancy which Heraeus points out between this account and
our passage, does not exist and was only occasioned by his errone-
ous assumption that the last mentioned quarrel is the one referred
to in the Dialogus. Helvidius was praetor in 70. Owing to his
contumacious and exasperating conduct toward the emperor (see
Epictet. Diss. Ι 2) he was eventually again expelled and subse-
quently executed (probably after 7 5). The Emperor, repenting of
his order, is said to have sent messengers to recall the executioners,
but they returned upon the false report that the imperial decree

· had already been carried out. Cf. Suet. Vesp. 15 Dio Cass. 68, 12.

The life of Priscus was written by Herennius Senecio for which work
he was afterwards executed by Domitian. Cp. Furneaux and Nip-
perdey ad Ann. XVI 28. — sapientiam used in place of philosophia

which the purist Tacitus seems to have avoided, for it occurs only
c. 19 15 21 23 30 -16 32 33 Ag. 4 Η. III 81. The same is true of
philosophi, found only c. 19 19 24 10 and Ann. XIII 42 qua sapientia
