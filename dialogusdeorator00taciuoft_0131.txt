PROLEGOMENA. cxxvii

23 8.15 26 8 28 2 29 1. 18 32 14 33 20) D has erred in giving the
inflectional endings which were habitually' abbreviated or, by eon-
fusinq single letters, easily misread 01· illegible in the original.
These errors, because of their instantly recognisable origin, are not
apt to perplex the critic; they possess, in fact, a distinct value, in
that they per-‘mit him, without incurring the risk of conjectural
audacity, to restore the genuine reading on internal grounds alone,
even unanimity in the MSS. furnishing no positive indication of
the reading of the archetypon. Michaelis’ statement that D was
written ‘tamquam per somnium' seems justified, when we observo
that it contains no fewer than 29 omissions (c. 5 2 7 12 8 29 9 4. 12.
31 10 8 12 11 14 12 16 17 19 7. 14 21 24. 37 22 18 25 14. 15. 27 26 21
29 6 30 17 31 18. 25 33 17. 18 35 6 36 20. 32), ten instances of ditto-
graphy (e. 6 6 12 18 15 8 24 8.9 25 3 26 7.15 28 19 37 10), one of
haplography (28 10 lusus [que] puerorum), and seven transpositions
(c. 6 8 10 18 19 14 28 26 30 11 40 8 41 14), of which the two first,
however, very probably represent the original reading. See notes
ad loc. Of possible interpolations, I have noticed but five: c. 5 18
imperii [famam], but see note3 10 2 inquit omnes3 15 2 Maternum
nostrum ,· 16 32 princeps 1110; 25 18 Caesar et.

The genuine reading has been preserved in D vs. ω, 111 0. 31 15
ira 32 18 detrudunt (detrudant—w) 32 quosi (= quos si) forte
(quod si—m). In c. 37 18 (10 expilatis, the preposition is probably
the false restitution of a lacuna, in place of ¹ant,’ which in Δ is
found after ³ utrumne.' See note ad loc.

4. Τ110 codex Famesianus or Neapolitanus (0) contains the
second part of the Annals (XI-XVI), the Histories⁷ Dialoqus (183
folio pages), Germania and the Suetonius fragment. It is a beau-
tifully written MS. Lacunae are indicated with care, either by
vacant spaces or by marginal notes of the scribe. It was known to
Lipsius, who valued it highly,²1⁷ as did all subsequent scholars till
Michaelis dethroned O in favor of AB. The MS. was lost from
view for a long time, until rediscovered by Niebuhr in Naples.²1⁸

2¹⁷ “Quum depravatissimus vulgo circumferretur libellus . . . admirabile est
quantum a Farnesiano codiee in eo sanando simus adiuti. Multi hiatus expleti,
verba et lineae integrae insertae, centeni aliquot loci emendati.'' Cp. Massmann
p. 7. That the MS. was written by a monk is evident‚ not only from the
picture of a monk at the beginning, but also from certain readings, such as
‘sanctitatis’ for ‘ civitatis ' (G. 10) and the omission of ⁴ divus ' in Dial. o. 17 8.

²¹⁸ Eckstein‚ Proley. p. 62 by a curicus error regarded this MS. as quite dis-
tinct from the Famesianus.
