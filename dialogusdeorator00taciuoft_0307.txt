me from my sleep,' namely, 111 order to convey some message from
the Emperor, or to bring the information that his master has arisen
and is ready to receive the early morning visits of his ‘friends'
Cf. Epictet. Diss. IV 8, 41-50, quoted by Friedlander 1⁶ p. 143.
Schaubach p. 5 and Weinkauff p. cnvur erroneously take ‘anhelans '
to mean ‘maxime studiosus,⁷ 111 which figurative sense the word
would be ἅπ. εῖρ. Cp. also Kleiber p. 75 note—incertus futuri:
Perhaps a reminiscence of Verg. Aen. VIII 580 spes incerta futuri
(cp. Schmaus p. 36). Incertus e. gen. is 111 prose first found in
Bell. Afr. 7 and then in Liv. Ι 7, 6. Frequently in the poets. In

to bequeath legaeies to the Emperor in their wills in order to insure
the carrying out of the other bequests, for, where 131113 8811131011 was
omitted, emperors such as Caligula, Nero and Domitian (Suet.
Calig. 38 Ner. 32 Dom. 12) often annulled the testament‚ appro-
priating the entire estate to themselves. Nero, according to Sueto-
nius l.c., even went 30 far as to enact ‘ut ingratorum in prin—
cipem testamenta ad fiscum pertinerent.' Maternus, therefore,
sincerely hopes that, rather 1311811 submit to such compulsion, his
fortune, unlike the colossal wealth of Marcellus and Crispus of
which Aper had spoken so admiringly (c. 8), might remain within
moderate limits, 30 83 11013 10 excite the covetousness of the prin-
ceps. No other writer, 113 may be observed, refers to this practice
more frequently than Tacitus. Of. Ag. 43 satis constabat lecto

filiae Domitianum seripsit,1aetatum eum velut honore iudicioque.
