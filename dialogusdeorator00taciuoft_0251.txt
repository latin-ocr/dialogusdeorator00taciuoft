preposition being no longer οι· but vaguely felt. In Latin it may
be said to assume noticeable proportions with Asinius Pollio and

gers had not previously seen the orators themselves, but could *only
know them from the descriptions of others.

Q. (acc. to C. I. A. III 1, 619) Vibius Crispus, like Marcellus, with
whom he is again associated by Tacitus in H. IV 42. 43, a notorious
