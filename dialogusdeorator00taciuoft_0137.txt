From this it appears, then, that the archetypon of the Ottoboni-
anus was corrected by an unknown hand after the Vindobonensis
had been copied from it, and in this emended state Fontanus or
the scribe of the Leidensis used it, the readings adopted being all
genuine.

There remains the question as to the interrelationship of CDA
and the very frequent agreement of D with the X class. This
problem has, in my judgment, also been solved by Seheuer. For
a glance at the readings given on p. cxxxi f. will show that GAD
form still another independent group (designated by Seheuer as y2)
of Y. As for D, which Michaelis regarded as the best represent-
ative of the Y class, for the reasons given, its frequent agreement
with AB²⁸⁰ is now seen to be due to the fact that its immediate
archetypon (γ’) had been corrected out of some member of the X
family, after ΟΔ had already been copied. The clear proof of this
is furnished by the following significant variants :

The interdependence of our MSS„ as finally determined, may be
represented by the subjoined family-mee, the arrows indicating in
what way the many coincidences between some of our MSS„
though derived from different famffies, may be accounted for :
