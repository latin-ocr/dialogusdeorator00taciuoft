Seheuer‚2⁸² that AB, by reason of their more faithful reproduction
of the archetypon, possess the greater validity. But this view is
erroneous. We may readily admit that the common archetypon of
AB was written by a less learned scribe than the parent MS. of Y;
he certainly was far inferior to the copyist of the latter in resolving
the many compendia, which unquestionably were a characteristic
feature of their common prototype. It also goes without saying
that a merely numerioal preponderance of genuine readings in one
or the other family does not in itself constitute a valid claim to
superiority, unless the nature of the variants themselves warrants
such an inference. On the other hand, it is no less true that a
MS. which fails repeatedly to give what the author must have
written, and in which the scribe, for the sake of slavish adherenee
to his copy, discards the genuine reading close at hand, ought not
