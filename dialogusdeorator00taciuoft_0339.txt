canorum oratorem et volubilem et satis aerem . . . et vehementem
et valde dulcem et perfacetum fuisse dicebat. Cp. Teuffel, Rom.
Lit. §136,4.—aut, does not here introduce an alternative, but is
practically equivalent to a copulative conjunction. Cf. c. 11 13
comitatus et egressus aut frequentiam 40 3 ne a Publio quidem
Scipione aut L. Sulla aut Cn. Pompeio abstinerent Cic. Orat. 1, 4
in poetis non Homero soli locus est aut Archilocho aut Sophocli
aut Pindaro sed horum vel secundis vel etiam infra secundos.

Recent editors, with the laudable exception of Wolff, insert G. Laelio aut
on the basis of Messalla's answer in c. 25 32 quod ad Servium Galbam et
C. Laelium attinet et si quos alios antiquiorum Aper agitare non destitit.
But this would consistently require the insertion of Ο. Carbonem in the
later passage, a suggestion actually made by Classen, thus furnishing a
unique instance of what may be called a reciprocal corruption! Vahlen,
Prooem. 1878-9 p. 5 f. has, moreover, drawn attention to two passages
which show an analogous negligence, is such it be. Cf. c. 21 f. with c.
26 24 f., where Messalla does not conform in his answer to Aper’s line of
argument, and again c. 25 15, where Asinius is added to the detractors of
Cicero, although omitted by Aper, c. 18 22.

4 merito antiquos vocaverimus: This marks the complete aban-
donment of Aper’s interpretation of ‘antiquus’ advocated with
an apparent show of sincere conviction in c. 16 18 ff. His final
retreat had already been prepared by c. 17 2, where see note.
—quosque alios, by a common attraction for aliis quos. Cf. c. 21
4 H. I 53 et Treveri ac Lingones quasque alias civitates . . . per-
culerat . . . miscentur Ann. II 74 consultatum inde inter legatos
quique alii . . . aderant, quisnam Suriae praeficeretur. -— horridi ct
impoliti etc.: The intentional accumulation of opprobrious epithets
serves the purpose of emphasising the low opinion which the
speaker has of these early orators. These rhetorical synonyms
are often variously combined in Cicero and Quint. e. g. de orat. Ι 8,
32. 49, 214 III 14, 51. 48, 185 Orat. 5, 20. 6, 20. 11, 36 Brut. 21,
83. 28, 107. 31, 117. 85, 294 Quint. IX 4, 17 X 2, 17 (see Bonnell

. Lex), Cp. the commentators 11. cc. and Causeret l. c. p. 175. Still

other synonyms are ‘aspen tristis, severus, ieiunus' opposed to
‘ornatus, elegans, politus, nitidus, limatus, laetus.' informis, also
Tac. Ann. XII 35.

6 Calvus the friend of Catullus (C. LIII) and himself a poet of
great distinction, was the leading representative of those who in
open opposition to Cicero's eclectio style of orator-y took the Atti-
