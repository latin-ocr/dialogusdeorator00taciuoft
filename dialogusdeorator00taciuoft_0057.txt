of an over-ingenious subtlety of analysis, are but called forth by the
infinite stylistic capabilities of the languages themselves. That
oratory and history, with which we are here more immediately
concerned, demand different rhetorical treatment, is particularly
emphasised in a well-known passage of the younger Pliny.¹⁰⁷

These two causes, then, the psycholoyical and the rhetorical, taken
in connection with the long interval of years that had elapsed
between the publication of the Dialogus and the larger historical
writings, would in themselves be sufficient to account for the
stylistic change which confronts us.

An examination, however, of the Agricola and the Germania,
which are chronologically intermediate between the Dialogus and
the Annals, shows that still a third factor had its share in effecting
the change under notice. For we observe that the Agricola and
the Germania have still many stylistic features in common with
the Dialogue which one would look for in vain in the subsequent
writings. Again‚ not a few characteristic usages, still rare in the
Dialogue, occur with constantly increasing frequency in the later
works‚ while others common in the Dialogus show a corresponding
decrease, often disappearing entirely in the Annals. In other
words, the style of Tacitus, as it is revealed to us in its maturest
and latest form, is to a considerable extent the result of a yenatio
development, passing gradually through various phases of growth or
dec-ay, which we arc often still able to trace. This fact, thanks to
Woelfflin, is now all but universally admitted,¹⁰⁸ and it will, there-
fore, suffice for our present purpose to illustrate the point by
adducing a few salient examples.¹⁰⁹

1⁰⁷ Plin. Ep. V 8, 9 f. habet quidem oratio et historia multa communia sed
plura diversa in his ipsis quae communia videntur, narrat illa, narrat haec scd
aliter: huic pleraque humilia et sordida et ex medio petita, illi omnia recondita,
splendida, excelsa conveniunt: hanc saepius ossa musculi nervi, illam tori qui-
dam et quasi iubae decent: haec vel maxime vi amaritudine instantia, illa
tractu et suavitate atque etiam dulcedine placet: postremo alia verba, alius
sonus, alia constructio.

1⁰⁸ Wolff, Die Sprache des Tacitus and Schanz l. c. are, so far as I know, the
only scholare who seem disposed to question the truth of Woelfflin’s observation‚
but even Wolff does so only 111 part, while Schanz merely denies it without the
slightest attempt at refutation.

¹⁰⁹ Cp. also Jansen pp. 73-78 Weinkauff pp. cxxxvii-cxlii. This index com-
parativus abounds in erroneous references and irrelevant quotations, and may
so far as stylistic questions are concerned, be practically dispensed with, the
monumental Lex. Tac. being nearly completed.
