John ad loc.‚ following Sauppe (Philol. XIX 262), deletes ⁴ eloquentiae ’
as an interpolation, perhaps caused by the preceding phrase ‘facultate et
usu eloquentiam contineri.' This is possible, and it must be admitted that
the word is not essential to the context. But when John bases his con-
demnation upon the supposition that it is not likely that ⁴ usus eloquentiae '
would be here put down as the ultimate outcome of theoretical instruction
rather than the result of actual experience‚ he seems to me to misinterpret
the passage which does not imply any such contradiction to c. 34 8, but
simply inculcates the necessity of rounding out one’s theoretical edueation
by subsequent (accedat) practical training‚ i. e. scientia and meditatio to-
gether with the requisite amount of native talent (facultas) must be sup-
plemented by ‘usu eloquentiae ’ before the orator is thoroughly equipped
for his future career.

i. e. the character of one's theoretical knowledge will determine the
expediency of its particular use and so inversely what the orator
carries out in practice, will depend upon the thoroughness of his
theoretical training. In other words, theory and practice are re-
ciprocally related and must always go hand in hand, one being
incomplete without the other. This opinion is apparently not
shared by Quintilian. Cf. XII 6, 4 est tamen proprius quidam
fori profectus, alia lux, alia veri discriminis facies, plusque, si
separeS, usus sine doctrina quam citra usum doctrina valeat, but
see also X 1, 1 ff. The obscurity of the phrase, admitted by the
author himself (cf. also c. 42 4), was doubtless due to his desire to
formulate an artistic epigrammatic antithesis. It is an example of
