Clodian episode. Op. Teuffel, Ram. Ιῼίιέ.ὅ ξ 191. Plutarch, though
he cites Tiro but twice (Cic. c. 41. 49) made very extensive use of
this work—scripsit: ‘has recorded.' The perfect expresses the
authoritative character of this information. The exclusive use of
the present tense, in citations from extant writers is a modern
idiom. Cf. Tac. Ann. XIV 2 tradit Cluvius . . . sed quae Cluvius
ceterique quoque auctores prodidere XV 54 ut plerique tradidere.

was assassinated in the year 43 Β. c., but the day and the month
(Dec. 7) are known only from this passage. That it was the month
of December, for this is omitted in our MSS. and was inserted

forces in Spain, receiving the honor-s of a triumph in the same year.
On his election to the consulship, he passed the so-called lex Pedia,
by which the assassins of Caesar were punished with ‘aquae et

the formation of the second 'triumvirate and the proscriptions
reached him. He with great difficulty prevented an open insur-
rection, but overcome with fatigue expired suddenly on the fol-
lowing night.
