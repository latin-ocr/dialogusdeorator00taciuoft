In support of this, Scholl seems to lay great stress upon the word
‘importasses,’ taking it in its usual sense of ‘importing from a
foreign locality,' but in that case ³ novum' were quite out of place,
for the ‘importation of Greek fabulae ' is as old as the Roman
drama itself. Scholl’s interpretation of novum, ‘subjects treated
for the first time as opposed to the hackneyed Greek fable' is also
at variance with the facts and involves a petitio principii. Aper
is uncompromisingly opposed to all poetic productions of Mater-
nus, as is unmistakably indicated by c. 5 9 f. Securus sit . . .
Saleius Bassus et quisquis alius studium poeticae et carminum
gloriam fovet cum causas affere non possit. Vahlen also observes
that we should rather expect ‘ecce Catonem’ in place of ‘ Medeam '
which play had not yet been mentioned, but this objection applies
with equal force to the Domitius. The author simply desired to
acquaint the reader with the titles of all of the dramas of Maternus
and the antithesis in the last clause naturally suggested the sym-
metrical grouping of the Greek and the Roman titles. For other,
more or less genuine instances of inconsistency, see Vahlen 1. c.
and notes to c. 12 6 15 14 16 27 18 3 19 11 25 31 26 26 32 27.
negotium=‘occupation‚ employment‚ business,' often with the
accessory notion of something troublesome or disagreeable (so here
and c. 9 11 where see note) and thus passing easily into the mean-
ing of ‘ law case or judicia] trial ² in which technical sense the word
is post-Aug„ if we except a doubtful passage in Plaut. Aulul. III
4, 1 (V. 453) qui cum opulento pauper homine ·coepit rem habere
aut negotium. Cf. 19 26 38 9 Ann. II 27 IV 15 XI 6 XIII 4
XVI 22. Negotium as an equivalent of res is collequial. Cp.
c. 18 29 mihi cum universis negotium est and c. 10 19 tecum
mihi, Materne res est. See Woelfflin, Phil. XXXIV p. 147 and
esp. Schmalz‚ Antib. II 129, where many more references are given.
—importasses=imponere, iniungere. This verb in its figurative
sense is invariably used of disagreeable things, and it is in this
light that Aper regards the occupation to which Maternus proposes
to devote himself. Cp. Hor. Ep. Ι 13, 5 odium libellis importes
and the examples from Cicero cited by Nagelsbach, Stilist. ξ 107.
——Domitiusz Nearly all commentators agre-e in identifying the
hero of this praetextata with L. Domitius Ahenobarbus (cons.
54 Rc.) the same whom Luc. VII 599 ff. glorified and of whom
Cic. Brut. 77, 267 says nulla quidem arte sed Latine tamen et multa
