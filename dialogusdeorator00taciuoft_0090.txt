lxxxvi PROLEGOMENA.

Quintilian, Pliny, Juvenal and Tacitus. Only a few selections
from Brotier’s restoration (?) can here be given, by way of illus-
tration. Thus the over-cautious Secundus is made to fulminato
‘ingentibus verbis' against the·vices of his timei? Seneca, who
is dealt with at length, represents in his eyes the very incar·
nation of everything that is loathsome and corrupt in morale,
oratory and literature. Even Largus Licinius—save the mark!
—comes in for a good deal of scathing denunciation3 an elab-
orate eulogy is pronounced upon Vespasian; Maternus is con-
gratulated 011 his resolution to quit the forum amid conditione
so hopelessly corrupt ; ²⁷⁴ the poet again gives his reasons for his
determination, and then suddenly comes to the rescue of the too
much abused rhetoricians (ἔ), Quintilian being lauded to the skies,
as a kind of prospective ‘vagae moderator summe iuventae, gloria
Romanae togae! ¹⁷⁵ Human affairs are then compared with the
human body, which passes from youth to maturity, and then to
decay, and we learn with regret that nature is not prodigal of genius, ·
and that every field of human activity has but one golden age, so to
speak. The language of men is a mirror of the times in which they
live, of which truth direct application is made. Maternus ends his
epigrammatic philosophy by a characterisation of the eloquence of
Demosthenes, and then proceeds as in the MSS. Some of Maternus'
utterances are not unworthy of the contemporary of the French
Revolution, and we actually hear of the powerful effect of elo-
quence in allaying internal dissensions or terrifying into retreat an
invading army of foreign enemies! There is, in fact, scarcely a
single thought in the entire supplement which is in keeping with
the context or relevant to the design of the treatise or possible in
the mouths of the interlocutors as Tacitus has drawn them! So
far as 1 can see, there is but one topic that can, without fear of
contradiction, be put down as having been dealt with ‘in the
portions now lost. It is, as already intimated,¹⁷⁶ a ‘more or less
detailed treatment of Attio eloquence, introduced to show that the
same causes that led to the development of a superior type of

1⁷4 One is sorely tempted to enquire why Secundus did not, under the
circumstances, also retire.

175 The savage criticism of Seneca (a bombastic amplification of Quintilian
X 1, 125 ff), as well as the eulogy of Quintilian himself, supposed to have been
uttered in 74 s75, is of course an amusing anachronism !
