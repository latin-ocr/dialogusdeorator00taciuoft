PROLEGOMENA. lxix

91 A. Ι). by Domitian for declaiming against the tyrants,¹³⁴ is now
justly abandoned. This identification is improbable on many
grounds. In the first place, it involves an impossible date for the
composition of the Dialogue. Then again, the term σοφιστής is in
no sense applicable to Maternus, the poet and pleader, not to
mention that it is intrinsically improbable that a man of such
idealistic aspirations should sixteen years later have degenerated
into a mere school-rhetorician. Finally, the name itself is exceed-
ingly frequent. A Curiatius ilfaternus is met with twice in inscrip-
tions‚¹⁸³ while Maternus (or Materna), apart from the Spanish jurist
so highly complimented by his fellow-townsman, Martial,¹³⁶ and the
two well-known Firmici Materni of the 4th century, occurs about
100 times-¹⁸⁷

Maternus is undoubtedly the protagonist of the Dialogue, and
may be considered, for the reasons given on p. xxxviii, as in a large
measure representing the author’s personal convictions. The scene
of the debate is laid in his house. He suggests the preliminary
discussion3 directs the course of the conversation, answering for
himself and for Secundus (c. 16 8); he suinmarises the arguments
of the various speakers (c. 24 1 ff. 33 1 ff.) 3 recalls Messalla to the
main theme at issue; requests him to continue, at the same time
assigning the particular topic which he desires him to treat. It is

⁷ also Maternus, finally, who closes the entire debate by a speech

designed to reconcile the opposing faotions.¹'³⁸

c. 13 were intended by Tacitus as a vaticinium ex eventu z See p. xxvii note 32.

and 23 Maternae) 111 (5 times) V (6—No. 950. 7956 from Gaul) VII (England

As the great preponderance of the name in Vols. II and XII can hardly be
accidentat the Maternus oi Tacitus must have hailed either from Spain or Gaul,
the presumption being very strong in favor of Gaul, because both Aper and
Secundus were natives of this province.

bis endlich der Dichter Maternus, welcher bei aliem Talent fiir das practisehe
Leben doch nur in contemplativer Thatigkeit Ruhe und Frieden sucht und
findet, auf den welthistorischen Standtpunkt tritt und den Zwiespalt vermittelnd
