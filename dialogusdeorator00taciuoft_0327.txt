30 rursus: According to Woelfflin, Philol. XXV p. 102 rursus
is the only permissible form in the Dialogus. In the first part of
the Annals, ‘rursum' largely preponderates, while in the last six
books both forms are used in about equal proportion. It may be
doubted, however, whether this discrimination was consciously
made by the writer. For our MSS. are very untrustworthy guides
to follow in such matters, and the long list of examples cited by
Neue Π 748-50 seems rather to establish the presumption that
both ‘rursus ⁷ and ‘ rursum ' were used promiscuously and without
consistency, although euphonic reasons in prose (cp. E. Wolff, Die
Sprache des T. p. 10), or metrical exigency in poetry may some-
times have decided the choice of the particular form. The same
applies to the use of ‘ adversus, -um ' (cf. c. 4 5) and other similar
adverbs, on which see Neue II p. 743 ff.—-isque annus - · ·
complectitur: According to the most recent modern calculations,
the phenomenon in question takes place in periods of 25816 solar
years.

32 incipit · ·- extitisse: Only apparently tautological, for inci-
pit is here practically equivalent to ¹ sequitur,' in which sense the
verb is used in Seneca: e. g. de ira I 10, 3 si nihil potest sine
adfectu et incipit par illi similisque esse de otio 8, 3 incipit omni-
bus esse otium necessarium. Ps. Quint. Decl. 26, 5. 166, 5. 213, 8.

33 quc nos sc. “ extitimus! A common ellipsis in Tacitus, e. g.
Ag. 23 G. 36 Η. Ι 37 II 76. Cp. G. Clemm, p. 102 and note c. 7 4.

17. 1 Sed transeo: ‘But this may suffice by way of introduc-
tion. Ι now pass on to show the injustice of the appellation ‘anti-
qui,’ when applied to the great Roman orators themselves.' Sed
is essential to the context, and ought not, therefore, to have been
bracketed by Baehrens—Menenium, ut puto, Agrippam: Cf. Liv. ΙΙ
32 placuit oratorem ad plebem mitti Menenium Agrippam (260 Β. 0.)
. . . prisco illo dicendi et horrido modo nihil aliud quam hoc (the
celebrated fable of the rebellious members of the body) narrasse
fertur . . . flexisse eum hominum mentes . . . Agrippam facundum
virum. Cf. also Dionys. Arch. VI 83 ff.

2 potest videri antiquus: Aper having no further use for the
rigid interpretation of ‘antiquus' is now not averse to applying
