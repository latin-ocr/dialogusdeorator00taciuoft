lxxiv PROLEGOMENA.

expressly indicated¹⁵¹ in the Dialogue, but clearly implied in the
significant omission of his ancestor in c. 25 15 ff. This extremely
meagre information can happily be considerably augmented from
Tacitus himself. ·

Messalla was born about 46 s? A. D.‚ for in the year 70 he had not
yet reached the senatorial age, which had been fixed by Augustus
at 25.1⁵² In the war between Vitellius and Vespasian (69 A.D.),
he was tribune of the seventh or Claudian legion, which formed
part of the Moesian army, and. subsequently joined the forces of
Antonius Primus, then stationed at Hostilia, near Verona, taking
part in the second battle of Bedriacum and at the siege of
Cremona.1⁵3 After his return to Rome, he seems to have written
historical memoirs describing, with the accuracy of an eye-witness,
the chief events of the war, a work which Tacitus utilised as a
secondary source for his narrative of this period.¹⁵⁴

Like the rest of the interlocutors, he was probably no longer
living in the reign of Titus,¹⁵⁵ and he does not appear in Pliny's
correspondence. The high compliments which Tacitus, in the
Histories, pays to his character and his oratorical accomplishments
coincide so perfectly with what is said of him and what he is made
to say in the earlier treatise, that we cannot but recognise in this

Messalla adeptus est, nondum senatoria aetate, ausus est pro fratre Aquilio
Regulo deprecari.

¹⁵3 Tac. III 9 f. Interim Aponius Saturninus cum legione septima Claudiana
advenit. Legioni tribunus Vipstanus Messalla praeerat, clarus maioribus, cyre-
9ius ipse et qui solus ad id bellum artes bonas adtulisset.

1⁵4 H. ΙΙΙ 25 rem nominaque auctore Vipstano Messalla tradam 28 Hormine
id ingenium, ut Messalla tradit, an potior auctor sit C. Plinius, qui Antonium
incusat, haud facile discreverim. On the probable time of publication of
Messalla’s memoirs and their relation to Pliny's history, cp. the discussion in
Fabia p. 184 ff. 234 ff.

155 The identification of Vipstanus Messalla with M. Valerius Messalla—
the cognomen is exceedingly common—who was consul with one M. Pedo
Vergilianus in 115 A. D., though advocated by the great majority of scholam,
from Lipsius, Schulze and Eckstein down to Steiner and Jansen, must be
rejected. Partly because we should in that case have certainly met with his
name in Pliny, who mentions his half-brother Regulus so often, partly because
it is incredible that a man of his prominence and talents did not reach the con-
sulship till past the age of 70 1
