careful training. This criticism the author believes to be unjust (maligne)
and he proceeds to refute it by telling us that Aper only affected to conceal
these accomplishments, which he possessed in a very high degree, because of
his conviction that natural gifts elicit a higher admiration than achieve-
ments won by dint of laborious study. Most commentators take industriae
et laboris as an objective genitive, thus destroying what seems, in my
judgment, the only psychologically admissible interpretation of Aper's atti-
tude. 1 have, therefore, had no hesitation in adopting Vahlen's easy
emendation. It were still simpler to take ind. et lab. as genit. of com-
parison, but this Grecism is very rare in Tacitus, e. g. Ann. IV 63 cui
minor quadringentorum milium res (cp. Woelfflin, Der yenet. comparat. in
Archiv VII 119) and it may be doubted whether the construction is permis-
sible in the earliest period of the historian's style. See Vahlen, Hermes 28, 358.

16-habiturus: A future participle in place of an entire clause,
first found in Livy (K'uhnast Liv. Synt. 267), is quite Tacitean and
particularly frequent with tamquam, quasi e. g. H. I 48 Ann. XII
49 xm 43. ep. Dr. sta ς 215. Here it is perhaps preferable
to assume the omission of the subj. esset, an ellipsis also very
common in Tac„ especially if a corresponding subj. follows which
prevents any possible ambiguity, e. g.‚ Ag. 24 idque . . . profutu-
rum, si . . . tolleretur. Cf. Dr. Stil p. 17 f. Wetzell 1. c. p. 50 ff.,
R. V. III p. 830 note 609, Heraeus, ad Hist. I 21 and Nipperdey
ad Ann. I 7.

Ch. 3-4. Maternus, so far from yieldiny to the proposal of
‚Secundus to omit in tlte publication of Itis traqedy those passaqes
which had recently qiven offence, states his determination to rema-in
true to his convictam, and informs liis friends tlzat Ite is already
preparinq another traqedy in which similar utterances will be found.
Aper deplores tlte precious time which the poet in liis opinion is
thus wastinq upon undiqnified subjecte· and unprofltable pursuits,
while his oratorical talents are in such demand. Maternus, however,
more than ever resolved to abandon the irksome duties of the fotum
for the companionsliip of tlte Muses, suqqests a renewed discussion
of a question often debated between him and his friend, reqardinq
tlte alleqed superiority of eloquence over poetry.

3. 1 igitur: Quint. Ι 5, 39 an sit ‘igitur' initio sermonis
positum dubitari potest, quia maximos auctores in diversa fuisse
opinione video, cum apud alios sit etiam frequens (e. g. Cicero,

Sallust, Quint. himself) apud alios numquam reperiatur (e. g.
Caesar, the two Senecas). Cf. Woelfflin, Archiv III 560 f., Neue,
