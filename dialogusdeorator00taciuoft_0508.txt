364 NOTES.

Spoletinus in 65 13. c. (Cic. Brut. 78, 271) for proposing laws, when

trib. pleb. (67 Bo), distasteful to the senatorial party, he was -

successfully defended by Cicero in two speeches, of which con-
siderable fragments together with the argument of Asconius have
come down to us. Cf. Ascon. Ped. p. 50-7 2 K.-S. and Orelli, Cic. IV
932-939. —M. Scaurum: M. Aemilius Scaurus aedile 58 B. c. praetor
of Sardinia 56, accused ³ rerum repetundarum' in 54. He was de-
fended by six ‘ patroni,' viz. P. Clodius, M. Marcellus, M. Calidius,
M. Messalla Niger, Q. Hortensius and Cicero, Cato being the judge.
The sensational trial ended in an acquittal. Cicero⁷s speech is only
preserved in fragments. Cf. Cic. Fragm. IV 954-965 Ascon. p. 18 ff.

21 Τ. Milonem: Cf. note c. 37 27. ——L. Bestiam: L. Calpurnius
Bestia, trib. pleb. 62 Β. c. one of the Catilinian conspirators (Sall.
Cat. 17), was accused ‘de ambitu' in 56 and quccessfully defended
by Cicero. Cf. Ep. ad Quint. frat. II 3, 6 a. d. ΙΙΙ. Id. Feb. dixi
pro Bestia de ambitu apud praetorem Cn. Domitium . . . maaeimo
conventu. No fragments of this speech have come down to us. —
P. Vatinium: Cf. notes c. 21 10 24 35. — concursu totius civitatis,
equivalent to an abl. abs. ‘ concurrente tota civitate.' So c. 6 5
concursu . . . hominum Ann. V 10 iuventutis concursu VI 50

’ multo gratantum concursu XII 47 concursu plurium. The abl. of

attendant circumstances is very characteristic of Tacitus. Cp. Dr.
scic p. 29 R. v. 111 688 note 569. —With the thought, ef. oio. de
opt. gen. 7, 22 ad quod iudicium (sc. Dem. et Aesch.) concursus
dicitur e tota Graecia factus esse Brut. 84, 289 necesse fuisse cum
Demosthenes dicturus esset, ut concursus audiendi causa ex tota
Graecia fierent.

22 constat· · · defensos ut· · · potuerint: The perfect subj. in a
consecutive clause depending upon a verb of past time, still rare in
pre-Aug. Latin, becomes more frequent With Livy and is thereafter
esp. common in Tacitus and Suetonius. Draeger, in his Untcrs.
zum Sprachqebr. der riim. Hist. Gustrow 1860 p. 5 regarded ‘potu-
erint ’ as dependant upon ‘constat' In H. S. Ι 268, it is recognised
as a legitimate illustration of the above usage, but in Stil p. 74
‘³ ut mit dem Conjunctiv des historischen Perfects fehlt im Dialogus
und in der Germania,’' he seems again to revert to his earlier
explanation of this passage. Possibly, ‘ potuerint ⁷ ’ is here merely
the apodosis of an unreal condition, the suppressed protasis having
to be supplied from ‘frigidissimos' “They might have inflamed
