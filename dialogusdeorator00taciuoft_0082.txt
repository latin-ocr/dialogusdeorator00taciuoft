Ι 3111 convinced that the explanation given by Becker and fol-
lowed by Habbe is the only true solution of the problem, but their
argumentation seems to lack precision and cogency, and has con-
sequently failed to carry conviction. Perhaps the following remarks
may contribute something to the more general acceptance of their
view.

The chief objection of the conservative critics against the assump-
tion of a lacuna seems to be that the MSS. furnish no clue to its
existence. But the non-indication of a lacuna is by no means a
clear proof of its non-existence. For while it may be admitted that
the writer of the archetypon of our MSS. may have been careful
enough to leave a vacant space, in the expectation that the missing
portioris might some day be found, the scribes of a late'r age, no
longer cherishing such hope, would either content themselves with
a few dots or a vacant space, which in turn might be easily over-
looked by subsequent copyists, or else they would at once write on
, continuously, thus cover-ing up all signs of an original gap. That
this happened repeatedly in actual practice is a fact indisputably
established by palaeographicalresearch; nor are such neglected
lacunae confined to the omissions of mere words and phrases.¹⁶⁷ Το

necessary to draw attention to an instance very near at hand, which
has nevertheless been completely overlooked even by the supporters
of a second lacuna in the Dialogus. Ι refer to the condition of Bk.
