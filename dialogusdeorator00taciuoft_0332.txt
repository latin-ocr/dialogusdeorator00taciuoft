188 NOTES.

hendet Brut. 17, 68 muta . . . et adde numeros et .. . . ipsa verba
compone . . . : iam neminem antepones. Cp. the many illustrations
given by Ki'ihner II p. 7 57-764 (esp. p. 7 60 f.) Dr. H. S. II 213-
221 (esp. p. 218 f.). On parataxis for hypotaxis in Tacitus, see
Dr. Stil ξ 237, who cites only a few instances of a principal clause
in place of a hypothetical one ε Ann. XIV 44 sane consilium
occuluit (i. e. ‘etiamsi,⁷ etc.) telum inter ignaros paravit XV 5
omitteret potius obsidionem aut se quoque . . . positurum, for nisi
omitteret. The other examples (H. IV 58 Ann. XIII 21) appear
to me less relevant—mox, ‘subsequently' In this sense mox,
uncommonly frequent in Tacitus (cf. Lex. Tac. p. 873 f.), seems to
occur first in the elder Pliny e. g. N. H. XVIII 35, 78, 341. Cf.
also Suet. OctaV. 47 Nero 6 a quo mox principe. The word is some-
times placed between attributive and substantive, but in other cases
it is never post-positive in Tacitus. Cp. Heraeus, Tac. H. Ι 72.

12 Claudii et Neronis: The two Claudian Caesars, who by a pe-
culiar coincidence reigned the same number of years, are here
closely combined3 the two Julian emperors are also grouped and
separated from Augustus, as indicated by ac (see following note)
and the introduction of another verb (adice). Precisely the same
arrangement is found in Tac. Ann. Ι 1 temporibusque Augusti di-
cendis non defuere decora ingenia . . . Tiberii Gaique et Claudii ac
Neronis res H. II 76 non adversus Divi Augusti mentem nec ad-
versus . . . Tiberii senectutem, ne contra Gai quidem aut Claudii
vel Neronis. It is in the highest degree improbable that the same
and by no means obvious order of grouping should have occurred
to two authors independently of each other, and I cannot but recog-
nise in this remarkable parallelism one of the many clear indica-
tions of the Tacitean authorship of the Dialogus. — ac · · - atque· - -
ac: Observe the formal symmetry of collocation. ¹ac, atque' join-
ing the various groups, While ¹ et ' combines the words within these
groups. Such polysyndeta with ‘ ac, atque' are rare. Cato is said
to have employed them frequently (Fronto, Ep. ad M. Caes. II 16
nam uni M. Porcio me dedicavi atque despondi atque delegavi.
Hoc etiam ‘atque' unde putes. Ex ipso furor). A very caco-
phonous instance is cited by Dr. H. S. 11 55 from Catull. LXVIII

15 2 haec atque illa dies atque alia atque alia. In Tacitus, cf. c.
39 16 and Ag. 31 ager atque annus . . . corpora ipsa ac manus silvis
ac paludibus emuniendis inter verbera ac contumelias.
