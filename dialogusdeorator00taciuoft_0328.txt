the term to Agrippa, although he lived some seventy years after
Demosthenes and Hyperides. This in itself is sufficient to betray
the casuistical character of his previous contention. Cf. also c. 18 4,
where he even includes Serv. Galba and O. Carbo among those who

To the argument in favor of the easy emendation ‘voletis,’ addueed
c. 1 6, we may add that ‘soletis' is also not in keeping with ‘ut puto,'

3 Gaesarem etc: C. Julius Caesar (B. c. July 13. lOO—March
15. 44), Μ. Caelius Rufus (c. 88—48>, O. Licinius Macer Calvus

Kuhnast, Liv. Synt. p. 18 ff.) Val. Max. Ι 5, 3 interrogavit quid

’ ita eo vultu esset Ι 7, 5 (Dr. H. S. ΙΙ 482 f.). Peter's examples
