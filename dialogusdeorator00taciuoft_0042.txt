xxxviii V PROLEGOMENA.

realisation of the principles for which they suffered. Under these
circumstances, prudence and moderatiori must determine our mode
of conduct, and danger must not be wantonly courted, so long as
honor and dignity are not jeopardised. Men like M. Lepidus,*⁹
therefore, L. Piso,⁵⁰ Memmius Regulus ⁵² and above all the historian's
own father-in-law⁶2 receive his unstinted applause. The lives which
these men lived proves, indeed, that there were not a few of
Tacitus' contemporaries who shared his opportunistic views. But,
so far as these have found'literary expression in extant utterances‚
the Dialogus is the only work which can be said to breathe a
political atmosphere similar to that which pervades the historical
writings of Tacitus.⁵⁸

It is, of course, impossible to determine with absolute con-
fidence to what precise extent the sentiments expressed by the
interlocutors reflect the views of the author, for Aper, Secundus,
Messalla and Maternus are unquestionably drawn to the life, and.
their individual characteristics stand out in bold relief ; neverthe-
less, the prominent position assigned to Maternus, the very signifi·
cance of his own utterances, and the unqualified approval which he
is made to give to Messalla’s explanation of the causes of the ,
decline of eloquence and to some of the salient features of Secundus’
argument prove conclusively that the poet-advocate must be re-
garded as the chief exponent of the writer’s personal convictions,
much in the same way as the Crassus of the de oratore is the
mouthpiece of Cicero's own views. But if this inference be correct,
and it has never been seriously denied, it is of the highest signifi-
cance to observe that the coincidences between the historical works
of Tacitus and the Dialogus, so far as they pertain to political
opinions, are practically confine-d to the speeches of Maternus !

contumaciam et deforme obsequium pergere iter ambitione ac periculis vacuum.

⁵³ It is also highly significant that the author of the Dialogus as well as
Tacitus in the Annals dates the beginning of Augustus' reign from the year 43
