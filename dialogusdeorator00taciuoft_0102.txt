author for his information, the errors included. But since the
data under notice are of a nature extremely well suited to a work
such as we must conceive the ¹ Acta’ of Mucianus to have been,
and as this collection is express-ly cited in the Dialogue, it will be
more methodical to assume this same publication as the direct
source of Tacitus, while Fenestella or Varro may possibly have
been among the informants of Mucianus.

But not only were the ‘Acta’ probably laid under contribution in
the two additional instances just dealt with, but Tacitus' indebted-
ness to the ‘Epistolae⁷ of Mucianus seems also not to have been
confined to the passage in which they are cited, for I feel convinced
that what we learn of the epistolary war waged between the ad·-
herents of the Attic school and Cicero (c. 18 21 ff. 25 23 ff.) is
directly based upon this identical compilation, it being again
extremely unlikely that Tacitus had recourse to the not easily
accessible original letters of Brutus and Calvus,1⁹⁵ when he might
have availed himself of Mucianus' labors. The same convenient ·
edition of these collected letters was doubtless used by Quintilian
and perhaps by Plutarch.¹⁹⁶

The sources I must still discuss one other possible source of Tacitus, to which
⁰f ⁰· 28 f. the Dialogus itself, however, furnishes no direct or indirect clue.

The remarks on the education of children, put into the mouth of
Messalla (c. 28 fi), are admittedly among the most interesting and
beautiful passages of the Dialogus. F. A. Wolf was, indeed, dis-
posed to regard them as the gem of the entire treatise, and even
Gutmann expressly exempts this portion from his otherwise dis-
paraging criticism. Now the impression of a certain maturity of
judgment and experience which these chapters unquestionably
leave in the mind of the reader, has led some scholars to think
that the author must have been more than 27 years of age when
this tirade against the laxity of contemporary educational methods
was written, from which it would follow that the Dialogue was not-
composed in the reign of Titus, and all that this inference implies.
But the early date as well as the Tacitean authorship of the
Dialogue rests upon too firm a foundation to be thus easily over--
thrown, for even admitting, what is by no means certain, that-
Tacitus at the age of 27 would not likely have given expression to
the views in question, it does not seem to have occurred to any one
