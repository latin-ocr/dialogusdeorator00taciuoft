PROLEGOMEN A. lxi

in the Dialogue, but could not, from their very nature, have ever
occurred in it, as they deal with the faults of “ elocutio ’¹ proper,
such as the κακόζηλον, hyperbole and the like.¹²⁰ But if so, we are
put upon the horns of a dilemma, of which it would be hard to say
which is the more absurd. For either Quintilian wrote a book “ de
causis corruptae eloquentiae ' and the Dialogus de oratoribus, but
by some strange accident repeatedly referred to the former only, or
else the two are identical, the author's citations being by an equally
strange accident absent from the extant treatise ¹²1—which had no
place for them anywhere 1

The remaining arguments adduced in favor of Quintilian pertain
to the matter and the form of the Dialogue, the treatise revealing,
it is contended, so many elements in common with the Institutio
Oratoria as to establish identity of authorship beyond question.

Now as regards the contents of the two works, there can be no
possible doubt, as we may at once admit, that many and even
striking points of resemblance exist, and they have been duly noted
in the Commentary,¹²2 but this fact can in no sense justify the
inference that has been drawn, for the following reasons :

(1) Similarity of subject matter necessarily leads to similarity in
its presentation.

(2) Very many of the coincidences collected by the writers
mentioned are not peculiar to Quintilian, but may be readily paral-
leled from other authors, notably Cicero, to whom both Quintilian
and Tacitus are alike largely indebted. This is equally true of the
numerous aesthetic criticisms of literary men, upon which undue
stress has been laid, for here, if anywhere, the great rhetorician is
almost wholly dependent upon earlier sources, not only in Greek,
but to some extent even in Latin literature, where we certainly
might have expected greater independence and originality.¹2⁸ These
judgments had in course of time become stereotyped aud common
property, so to speak.

¹²1 It is amusing to find some early advocates of the Quintilian theory getting

' over this difficulty by supposing that the passages in question may possibly all

have been miraculously accumulated in the lacuna after c. 35 l
