with a substantive serves as a substitute for a missing adjective.
So e.. g. Cic. pro Plano. 5, 12 Cn. Manlium non solum ignobilem,
verum sine virtute, sine ingenio (where see Landgraf's note) and
very frequently in Tac. e. g. c. 41 11 sine obsequio, sine severitate,
contumax, temeraria, adrogans G. 35 sine eupiditate, sine impo-
tentia, quieti secretique nulla provocant bella H. I 9 invalidum,
sine constantia, sine auctoritate Ann. III 15 Tiberium sine misera-
tione, sine ira, obstinatum clausumque vidit XIII 35 sine galeis,
sine loricis, nitidi et quaestuosi. Cp. A. Gerber, Philol. XXXIV

22 una ex sordidissimis artificiis=una omnium artificiorum
sordidissima. ‘una' is used by a kind of attraction for ‘unum,’
because the personification of eloquence and her degradation to a
servile occupatiori, indicated also by ² detrudunt ' and ‘ sine ingenu-
itate' are throughout uppermost in the mind of the speaker. On
these constructions, common in both Greek and Latin, see Kiihner
II ‘21 f. R. V. III 14 note 329. —unus, when added to a superla-
tive, either in the genitive, or more rarely with a preposition‚ as
here, imparts special emphasis. Cp. R. V. III 182 note 403 ⁰. -—
sordidissimis ‘ vulgar, low.' A characteristic epithet, illustrative of
the contempt of the higher classes for handicrafts or professions,
followed for the sake of pecuniary gain. Cf. Tac. H. I 4 III 74
Ann. IV 62 sordida mercede XI 6 and Sen. Ep. 108, 36 in a
similar passage: qui philosophiam velut aliquod artificium venale
didicerunt—primam et praecipuam: “ Praecipuam ⁷ was probably
added to prevent ‘primam’ from being taken in the numerical sense
of “ first,' which would imply that Messalla was about to give other
reasons, but this he had originally no intention of doing. See
below. The same alliterative collocation occurs in Tac. Ann. VI 4
praecipuus olim . . . et tunc primus and in Quint. II 15, 1.

The MSS.‚ as in Cic. Orat. 32, 115, vary between ‘ ego ' and ⁴ erg0.' The
former seems far more suitable to the context, because of the implied
antithesis with ⁴ si testes desiderantur,' i. e. I myself believe this to be etc.’
but if etc) Again, this closing sentence intentionally recalls„ by its very
form, the question put to Messalla by Maternus in c. 24 ext. exprome nobis
. . . causas cur in tantum ab eloquentia eorum recesserimus. Messalla.
therefore, having partially complied with this request‚ very appropriately
ends his speech: hanc eqo etc. The latter collocation appears to me prefer-
