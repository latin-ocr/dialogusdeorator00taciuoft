the forum, is implored not to waste his strength upon ‘ artes levi-
ores,’ lest they incapacitate him for the higher calling of the
orator. Levitate is used, because the ‘iaculum' (ἄκων, ἀκόντιον) was
a Ziqlzt weapon. Cf. Lucian, Anach. 32 ext. κοῦφα ἀκόντια.

Andresen (Emend. p. 169) deletes iaetu, on the ground that the MS.
reading involves an absurd antithesis ‘ quia diversissimi generis sunt levi-
tatis et iactus notiones.’ But (1) instances of an analogous inconcinnity
are not rare in the Dialogus, cf. note c. 1 21 and iactu may well have been
preferred, because of the fondness of our author, as Wolff ad loc. observes, for
grouping etymologically related or phonologically similar words. (2) Andre-
sen unfortunately overlooked, and this is fatal to his emendation, that by
the deletion of iactu, ‘levitas ⁷ is predicated of the discus which was a very
heavy missile, as compared with the javelin. Cf. Mart. XIV 164 pondera
disci. Stat. Theb. VI 649 pondera vix toto curvatus corpore iuxta Ι deiecit.

vanescere: a poetic and post-Aug. word, of frequent occurrence
in TacituS, but comparatively rare in other writers, only once in
Quintilian (IV 3, 8). Cicero uses the compound evanescere. Cp.
note c. 1 18. On the gradual decay of powers, if neglected, see the
remarks of Plut. An seni c. 16 (p. 792 A—D).

25 ab auditoriis et theatris: Dramatic performances were no
longer given in Rome in the days of Vespasian‚ Maternus' plays,
like those of Seneca, being book dramas which the author recited
before an audience, previous to their publication. The fictitious
encounters of the drama enacted in recitation-halls are contrasted
with the real contests of the orator in the forum. Cf. Pliny, Ep.
II 3, 5 f. Nos enim qui in foro verisque litibus ferimur, multum
malitiae . . . addiscimus. Schola et auditorium et ficta causa res
inermis, innoxia est. For the use of military metaphors as applied
to eloquence, cf. 1uv.V11 17 3 ad pugnam qui descendit, and notes
c. 5 ext. 26 19 ff. 37 ext.

This evenly balanced antithesis is rudely destroyed by et ad causas,
an interlinear gloss to vera proelia which subsequently found its way
into the text. Mahly p. 21 and Knaut p. 11 have, independently of each
other, deleted the objectionable clause, but editors have refused to attach
any validity to their reasons. But the words in question clearly violate
two scylistic laws of Tacitus, which may be thus formulated: 1. When one
and the same preposition can 90vern two noune, J'oz‘ned by et, ac or atque, the
preposition r1'3 not repeated. Only three apparent exceptions (G. 24 H. Ι. 51.
74) out of 252 instances are found. 2. The ,preposition never varies with
two substantivas Joined by et, ac or atque, provided one and the same preposi-
ῖίοη can do duty for both noune. These rules are not observed in the case
of disJunctive conjunctions or in asyndetic collocations, and it is to this
class that the exx. cited by Nipp. Ann. II 68 Dr. Stil p. 42 and the exhaus-
