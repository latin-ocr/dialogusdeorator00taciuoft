43 alios recens haec lascivia deliciaeque et omnia ad voluptatem
multitudinis imperitae composita delectant IX 4, 144 ff. and Cic. ,
de orat. I 16, 70. —levitate sententiarum: ‘Shallow thoughts! Cf.
Cic. de nat. deor. Π 17, 45 opinionis levitas Quint. XII 10, 73
falluntur enim qui vitiosum et corruptum dicendi genus quod aut
verborum licentia exultat aut puerilibus sententiolis lascivit aut
immodico tumore turgescit aut inanibus locis bacchatur sqq. Op-
posed to locos laetiores in c. 22 6.—licentia compositionis: i. e.
abuse of the laws of prose rhythm, opp. to ars compositionis (c. 22 6).
Cf. Quint. IX 4,142 si sit necesse, duram potius atque asperam
compositionem malim quain effeminatam et enervem, qualis apud
multos et cotidie magis, lascivissimis syntonorum modis saltat
Pers. I 98 ff. quidnam igitur tenerum et laxa cervice legendum ἶ) Ι
Torva Mimalloneis implerunt cornua bombis sqq.—Observe the
alliteration‚ doubtless designed to bring out each item of the
scathing indictment into strong relief. So also c. 20 6 ff. where see
note and Proleg. p. cxvii.

9 histrionales: a vox Tacitea, again used c. 29 11 h. favor and
Ann. I 16 histrionali studio, but not elsewhere in Latin.

10 quodque· · · debeat i. e. And though these abuses are such, as
one should scarcely permit even to be heard, yet very many actu-
ally boast that. On this consecutive subjunctive, cp. Ki'ihner II p.
855 f. and Peter ad loc.

Debeat is the reading of all our MSS„ which we have no right to emend,
unless it can be shown to be untenable. Nevertheless John, although
forced to admit that ‘debeat’ is possible, is at great pains to show that
‘debebat,' an emendation of Muretus, ought to be substituted. But even
granting that the imperfect ind. like ἔδει, ἐξῆν in Greek, may express
unreality in the present, John's view involves the further necessity of
taking ‘quod . . . debeat' as the object of ‘iactans,' the infinitives becom-
ing epexegetic, a far-fetched and unnatural construction. Finally, if Mes—
salla, as John contends, wished to express his emphatic condemnation of
the practices in question with the implied regret that they had, up to his
time. passed without deserving censure, vix would also be out of place.

laudis et gloriae: A very common collocation. ln Tacitus again
c. 41 23 and H. IV 14. “ On laus, fama, cf. note c. 7 11, fama, gloria,
ef. note 18 1. —locoz ³ In place of . . . and as a proof of,⁷ a kind
of zeugma, for with reference to ‘laudis et gloriae,⁷ ¹ cantari salta-
rique’ is the cause ; with reference to ‘ingenii,' one of its outward
manifhstations. See Peter ad loc.
