126 NOTES.

See Heller, Philol. LI p. 347. Hence ‘ si ita res familiaris exigat'
is in its proper place, and Wolff's suggestion to transpose the
phrase after ‘quidem,' or Andresen's to supply it in thought, is not ¹
only superfluous but not in keeping with the sense of the passage.
——genium propitiare: Here used in the sense of ³ genio indulgere,
to enjoy the good things of life! Cf. Pers. V 151 indulge genio :
carpamus dulcia. These phrases embody virtually one and the
same idea—a fulness of expression due to the speaker-'s desire
to inculcate the importance of pursuing a profession which will
enable a man to acquire, as Aper himself had done, affluence, high
political positions and an enviable reputation, merely by his own
intellectual efforts and in the face of discouraging obstacles. The
commentators less correctly take ‘ genium propitiare' in its literal
sense, in reference to the ancient superstition of tutelary spirits
(on which cp. Pauly, R. E. 111 693 L. Preller, Ram. Myth. p. 566
Smith, Dict. Bioqr. ΙΙ 241 f. and Kiessling, Hor. Ep. II 1, 143),
thus assuming that the poet Bassus had hitherto been invoking the
good will of the ‘ genius' of another, which he is now called upon ¹
to abandon in favor of his own tutelary deity. With the thought
itself, cf. Sen. Ep. 15, 10 quam iucundum sit nihil poscere, quam
magnificum sit plenum esse nec ex fortuna pendere, and Shake-
speare, Henry VIII “ How wretched is that poor man that hangs on
princes’ favors.'

29 adice quod, like ‘adde quod' formed on the analogy of ‘accedit
quod' (cp. R. V. III p. 496 Schmalz, Lat. Synt. p. 499), is first found
in Liv. XXIII 5, 9 adicite ad haec quod. Neither adice nor adde
quod occurs elsewhere in Tacitus. Cp. also Sen. Contr. IX praef.

3, once in Plin. Paneg. 53, 3. and Quint. II 17, 40 adiciunt his qui
contra sentiunt quod. It is, however, especially characteristic of

the younger Seneca, but usually in the form ³ adice nunc quod,' e. g.
Dial. II 17, 4 de ira III 5, 7 de tranq. 15, 3 de clem. I 2, 2. 8, 6
II 6, 1 de benef. III 7, 4 Ep. 40, 4 ; 70, 3. 8. 153 100, 63 114, 13.
30 elaborare et efficere: Ex in composition, especially in such
words as elaborare and efficere seems to add an intellectual element
to the original meaning. Cp. R. V. II 19 f. note 322, a view
clearly confirmed by a passage in Plin. Ep. V 20, 5 Iulius Candi-
dus . . . solet dicere aliud esse eloquentiam, aliud loquentiam. The
same synonyms are joined by Cic. ad fam. IX 16, 2. — conversatio
is a post-Aug. word, first found in Vell.- II 102, thereafter frequent,
