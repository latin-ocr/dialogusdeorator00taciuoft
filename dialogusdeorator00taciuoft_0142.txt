cxxxviii PROLEGOMENA.

has been universally, though unjustly, rejected by previous editors,
still another pertains to two words habitually confused in our
MSS„ so that the correct reading in AB may well be accidental,
while the third is perhaps due to scribal emendation. Out of
seventeen examples in which AB find a companion in D of the Y
class, the three MSS. furnish sim correct readings, but only one of
them is in any way noteworthy (c. 21 17). The Y class gives the
genuine reading in fifty-onem instances out of a possible sixty-twol!
The superstitious respect so generally entertained for the X family
must, therefore, in the face of the evidence just presented, be
abandoned. The Y family, albeit it has suffered at the hands of
learned and unlearned scribes, represents as a body the purer
tradition, although some of its individual members may be in a
number of instances less trustworthy guides than A, for B itself,
or its prototypc, as wc have seen, was not only subjected to the
conjectural revision of the learned Pontanus, but was subsequently

corrected out of the Y class. A does indeed faithfully reproduce '

its archetypon. But that archetypon must yield the palm to Y,
which has proved itself to be more accurate in preserving what
Tacitus must have written.

²⁸9 c. 28 26 30 21 are included because these readings, though probably not
genuine, are closer to the original, AB being unquestionablv corrupt.
