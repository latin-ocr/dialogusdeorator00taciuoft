(b) Ethioal and Social Views.

One of the most characteristic features of the historical works of
Tacitus 'is his almost pathetic longing for the irrevocable days of
old. *mid the moral degeneracy which he saw about him, he
fondly conjures up a primitive golden age of justice and innocence,
and in the Germania pictur-es, for the benefit of his contemporaries,
a stul-dy race not yet contaminated by the vices of civilised Rome.⁶⁴
The terms ‘priscus‚ antiquus, vetus’ are everywhere laudatory
epithets. Still he does not give way to despair, but recognises that
his own age is not altogether incapable of noble achievement, and
that the halo which envelops the past is apt to blind us to the
good qualities of which no period is wholly destitute.

These views coincide in all particulars with the sentiments in
the Dialogus. Messalla deplores the indifference of his contem-
poraries for the ‘mores antiqui';⁶⁵ the golden age of pristine purity
is pictured in glowing colors by the poet Maternus ;66 antiquus,
vetus and priscus are invested throughout with the same signifi-
cance as in the historical works and the habit of idealising the past
at the expense of the present is repeatedly alluded to.⁶⁷
