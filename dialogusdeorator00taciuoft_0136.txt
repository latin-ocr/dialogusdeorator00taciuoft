Moreover‚ EV agree 63 timess& as against ABCDA. Of these
variants, 20 are of an orthographical nature, and 10 give the
qenuine readings, as against 26 111 which the other MSS. are
correct3 in ‘che remaining all the MSS. are corrupt. EV is thus
seen to be an independent group of the Y class, a conclusion which
Scheuer places beyond all possible doubt by the following pas-
sages : ²²⁸

The coincidences of EV (y1) with AB can therefore only be due
to the original agreement of Y and X. A number of readings are
also cited by Scheuer (p. 31), in which E has a solitary companion
in B, which might seem to point to direct indebtedness of E to B,²”-’·⁹
but: this inference is refuted by an examination of the following

table (Scheuer p. 32) :

2²⁷ Scheuer pp. 12-14. Also c. 26 13, misplaced by Scheuer.
22⁸ The same conclusion is reached by an examination of the readings of the
Germania, in which H (Hummelianus) occupies the same relation to V, as Ε

does in the Dialogus. Cp. Scheuer pp. 15-17.
