by Cassius Severus and Seneca, and he vehemently protests against
the disparagement of contemporary rhetoric at the' expense of the
ancient type of eloquenoe, which he regards as no longer suited to
the demands made upon modern orators by the altered taste and
the higher culture of his time.

In giving a characteristic tone to Aper's diction, the author dis-
plays greater skill than in the stylistic individualisation of the
other interlocutors. It is typified by redundancy of expression, a
fondness for metaphors, often singular and bold, and an occasionally
peculi-ar vocabulary, all of which features are far less conspicuous,
if not wholly absent, in the speeches of Maternus, Messalla or
Secundus.¹⁴⁸ How far Aper's style is a faithful reproduction of
the original, can, of course, not be determined. The fact, however,
that the man himself, drawn to the life as he seems, has been
invested with some touches which were unquestionably copied from
Cicero's portrayal of Antonius in the de oratore, suggests the prob-
ability that Aper's speeches, with their numerous Ciceronian remi-
niscences in thought and phraseology, are also from the formal side
an artistic production of the author, the really historical elements‚
if such exist at all, being exceedingly few in number.

JULIUS SECUNDUS is far better known to us, for Quintilian
speaks of him in three passages: X 1,120 Iulio Secundo, si lonqior
oontiqisset aetas clarissimum profecto nomen oratoris apud posteros
foret; adiecisset enim atque adiciebat ceteris virtutibus suis quod
desiderari potest, id est autem ut esset multo maqis puqnax et
saepius ad curam rerum ab elocutione respiceret. Ceterum inter-
ceptus quoque magnum sibi vindicat locum: ea est facundia tanta
in explicando quod velit gratia, tam candidum et lene et speciosum
dicendi genus, tanta verborum etiam quae adsumpta sunt proprietas,
tanta in quibusdam ex periculo petitis significantia 3, 12 aequalem
meum atque a me, ut notum est, familiariter amatum, mirae facun-
diae virum, infinitae tamen curae XII 10, 11 elegantiam Secundi.
He was probably a knight, and has very plausibly been identified
by O. Hirschfeld with the Σεκοῦνδος ὁ ῥήτωρ (i. e. the well-known

¹⁴³ Some of these features, from a mistaken notion of the purpose for thch
they are designem, have been severely censured and used as an argument
against the Tacitean authorship of the Dialogue‚ but, as Weinkauff (p. cxxxv)
has well observed‚ emphatic reiteration‚ while possibly objectionable to a reader,
is in itself not ill-suited to a spoken speech which purports to represent an actual
improvisation.
