cogita Sen. de benef. IV 34, 5 sapiens utramque partem eius cogi-
tat. Comparatively frequent in Cicero. Cp. Peter's note ad loc.,
and. Stuerenburg‚ pro Arch. VI 14.

4 sermo ‘talk of the town! Cic. pro Mil. 12, 33 in . . . civitatis
sermone versantur. On the subjects of Roman gossip, cp. Fried-
lander S. G. Ι p. 431 f.

5 celeberrima. tum ingenia fori: celebris (celeber not in Tac), as
a synonym of ‘clarus' is perhaps first found in Tibull. ΙΙ 1, 33.
(Neue 11⁸ 17). In classical prose it is not used of persons, excepting
once in Livy XXVI 27 , 16 (but see Weissenborn’s note ad loc.
and Kuhner, Cic. Tusc. Disp. V 9).—tum, as well as defuit, con-
temnebat, nesciebat below, show that both Aper and Secundus
were dead at the time the Dial. was written. Op. Prol. p. xxvi.—
ingenia sori, ought not to have been objected to, even if the expres-
sion were not exactly paralleled by Quint. X 1, 122 sum1nahodic
quibus inlustratur forum ingenia, where Peterson might have cited
this passage.

6 quos · · utrosque: for the classical quorum utrumque. The
plural may here be due to a kind of attraction, but ‘utrique ⁷ is also
not infrequently used, where two individuals, although quite dis-
tinct, are regarded as belonging closely together. Exx, in Tac. are
c. 16 22 G. 34 and in the second part of the Annals (XI 1 XV 55.
63 XVI 11. 21. 32). Cp. Schmalz in R. V. ΙΙΙ p. 30 f. Antibarb.
s. v. ‘uterque,' Lat. Sym. II p. 548. No instances of the plural of
‘uterque' seem to occur in the younger Pliny and only one in
Quint: V 10, 43 quorum utrorumque ratio—non modo: non (nec,
neque) modo is not separated by an intervening word unless this
is in turn joined by ‘et' or ‘que' to another word, e. g., c. 28 20 11011
studia modo curasque 32 6 non doctus modo et prudens 37 10 non
viribus modo et armis. H Ι 50. Ag. 2 is the only exception. Un-
separated non modo occurs G. 15. 45 H. I 15, Α1111. Ι 77 II 45 3 III
19 XIII 20 XIV 1 XV 21. 44. Sed quoque is always separated:
c. 37 10 Ag. 2 H. Ι 50. 57. Followed by sed etiam : c. 32 6 Ag. 3
G. 45 Ann. IV 35; by sed . . etiam: c. 28 20 Ann. II 45 XIV 1
XV 21. 443 by sed et: G. 153 by sed: Ag. 3 H. Ι 4; by etiam:
Ann. I 77 III 19 IV 35. On non solum—sed etiam, cf. c. 7 13;
on non tantum, cf. c. 14 16 and, in general, Nipp. Ann. I 60 Woelff-
lin, Plzilol. XXV 110 Pohlmann p. 31 ff.

The antithesis lies between ‘in iudiciis . . . audiebam' and ‘domi asse-
ctabar.’ It is, thereiore, evident that the MS. reading ‘ non utrosque modo '
