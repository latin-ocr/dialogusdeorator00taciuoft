perhaps to that from which Spira and Puteolanus printed their
texts (for b often agrees with their readings), cannot be accurately

21³ The identity of many readings of b and the H arleianus (Peterson p. lxxix)
simply confirms the statement made above, that this codex was closely related
to the MSS. used in the earliest printed editions. It should also be noticed‚
what Peterson fails to point out, that in all the passages in which H and b agree,
they give a false reading, except twice (quia—c. 21 29 invenies—c. 29 13), where
AB, alone of our MSS„ go wrong! Again‚ in all cases of disagreement, H is
invariably wrony, except in c. 32 3ο, where the genuine reading vobis, though
universally rejected in favor of ‘a vobis' (b), is found in all our MSS.1 See
