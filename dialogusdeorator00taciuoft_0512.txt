Ch. 40 8-42. Maternus, in closinq the discussion, endeavors to
reconcile the opposinq parties, represented by Aper on the one hand
and by Messalla and Secundus on the other. He freely admits that
the peculiar conditions of the Roman Republic were hithy conducive
to the rise of eloquence, but he reminds his hearers that such orator-
ical excellence was after all acquired at the expense of political
stability and tranquillity. Eloquence, as history attests, has ‘never
thriven in law-abidinq and peaceful communities ,· it is the offsprinq
of license and would be as useless in a state where all was peace and
virtue, as a physician amonq a people free from disease. Recall the
past we cannot, nor were this a consummation to be wished ; it
therefore becomes the duty of all to rest content with the qood which
one's own time undoubtedly offers, and to refrain from belittlinq that
of some other epoch.

pp. lxxv—lxxx.

8 non de otiosa et quieta re loquimur: An unmistakable allusion
to the words of Secundus in c. 36 4 f. composita et quieta et beata
republica, where see note. Cf. also c. 37 30 nos de ea re loqui quae
facilius turbidis et inquietis temporibus existit.

Although the organic connection with the preceding has been lost in the
lacuna, ,the parallel passages just cited and the antithesis in ‘alumna
licentiae ' render it all but certain that Tacitus wrote ‘ re publica ’ here or
understood ⁴ res' in that sense (see Dict. and note c. 21 21.) i. e. Eloquence
is not the offspring of a ‘bene constituta civitas‚' but ot' anarchy.—
‘Gaudere' of abstract or inanimate things, though not rare (see note
below), is also far less bold, when said of ‘res publica‚’ which is often
peisonified, than of so nondescript a word as ‘res' In c. 37 30, the pre-
ceding ‘rei publicae‘ as well as ‘temporibus' leaves no doubt as to the
meaning of ⁴ re.' The archetypon probably read ⁴ r. p.’ (see p. 50), the
second letter having been accidentally omitted in our MSS.
