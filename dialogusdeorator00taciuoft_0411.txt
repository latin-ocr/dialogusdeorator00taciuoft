11 cantari saltarique: A careful modulation of voice and appro-
priate gestures were considered essential in an orator's education
(cf. e. g. Cic. Orat. 17, 56—18, 60 de orat. Ι 28, 128), but these
accomplishments began to degenerate even in Cicero's own time
(Orat. 18, 57 Brut. 62, 225) into mere vocal affectation and extra-
vagant gesticulation, and during the Empire, this abuse of originally
admirable practices had become so general (cf. Sen. Suas. II 10
explicationes Fusci quas nemo nostrum non aliis alia inclinatione
vocis velut sua quisque modulatione cantabat) as to 0311 forth the
severe censure of men of taste and culture. See 0. g. Quint. XI 3,
57 sed quodcunque ex his vitium magis tulerim quam quo nunc
maxime laboratur in causis omnibus scholisque cantandi quod
inutilius sit an foedius nescio. quid enim minus oratori convenit
quam modulatio scenica 181 non enim comoedum sed oratorem
volo . . . non inmerito reprehenditur pronuntiatio vultuosa et gesti-
culationibus molesta et vocis mutationibus resultans . . . sed iam
recepta est actio paulo agitatior Plin. Ep. Π 14, 12 f. pudet
referre quae quam fracta pronuntiatione dicantur, quibus quam
teneris clamoribus excipiantur. Plausus tantum ac potius sola
cymbala et tympana illis canticis desunt, ululatus quidem (neque
enim alio vocabulo potest exprimi theatris quoque indecora laudatio)
large supersunt.—commentarios=‘explicationes' in the passage
from Seneca just cited. See also note 0. 23 10.

‘sicut his . . . 013111 . . . ’ 111 my judgment a hopelessly corrupt passage,
neither ‘clausula' nor the generally accepted reading ‘exclamatio’ being
free from serious objections; illa exclamatiO, followed by an epexegetic ‘ut,'
has indeed found a solitary companion in Petron. 25 hinc etiam prover-
bium natum illud ut dicantur (adduced by Vahlen), for the examples cited
by John from c. 26 31 and Cic. de orat. I 13, 56 do not seem to me anal-
ogous. But the introduction of so rare a construction by conjecture is in
any case justifiable only it· absolutely required by the evident meaning of
the passage. In the present instance, this is far from being the case,
for by reading ‘exclamatio,' the epigrammatic antithesis ‘ut . . . saltare ’
would be attributed to the modern rhetoricians themselves, whereas it is
suitable only to their critics. The other attempts to fill out the lacuna,
enumerated on p. 33, are either palaeographieally improbable or at best
but ingenious guesses which cannot carry conviction.

13 tenere dicere · ·- diserte saltare: As the arts of eloquence
and dancing in the modern school have virtually coalesced, their
attributes also are interchangeable (Andresen). tener, here equiva-
lent to ‘lascivious, wanton,' occurs as an epithet of dancing also
in Cic. Pis. 36, 89 cum tui's teneris saltatoribus.
