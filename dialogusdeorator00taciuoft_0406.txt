27 9 and Cic. de orat. Π 89, 363 gaudeo iudicium animi mei com-
probari. Brutus alone, Messalla contends, gave expression to his
convictions frankly and openly, being free from malice and envy,
which influenced the criticism of the others. The commentators
assume a zeugma here, supplying ‘iudicasse' (Peter) or ‘locutos
esse,’ but this is based upon the erroneous supposition that ‘iudi-
cium. animi' necessarily designates ‘sincere conviction,⁷ whereas
the phrase derives its precise meaning, in bonam or malam
partem, solely from the context. ‘Locutos esse' is, moreover,
open to the objection mentioned in c. 24 5. See also Clemm, De
breviloq. Tac. p. 140.—With this high estimate of Brutus’ charac-
ter, cf. Quint. X 1, 123 scias eum sentire quae dicit Caesar ap. Cic.

H V 10.-c. Laelium: Aper in the passage directly alluded to
had mentioned Galba and Carbo. The inaccuracy of Messalla’s
reference must be admitted, but it was doubtless intentional, in
order to iinpart an air of spontaneity to what purports to be an
informa] conversation among friends. To insist on bibliographical
exactness, as some have done, is absurd. Cp. crit. note c. 18 3. —-

ter verbis etiam uti paullo magis priscis Laelius. But compared
to Galba, his style was less archaic (Brut. 24, 94).
