which we possess, after an interoeninq space of only THREE on noun
munus, continues with ‘quattuor et quadraginta orationes super ea
re habitae,' and yet there is not only a huge gap in the narrative,
covering a period of two years, but modern scholars, following
Lipsius, even begin a new book at this point, no previous editor
having had the slightest suspicion of a lacuna 1¹⁶⁸ Now when it is
observed that the editors of the Dialogus before Beroaldus do not
even indicate a lacuna after c. 35 (doubtless because they found
none in the MSS. from which their text was printed) and that our
best MSS. are some four centuries younger than the Mediceus and
incomparably inferior to it in point of scholarly accuracy and care,
it is certainly no rash inference to assume that the scribes of ’ our
late MSS. may possibly have failed to mark a lacuna after c. 41 7,
supposing it to have existed in the archetypon, when a vacant space
of three or four letters was thought sufficient to represent an im-
measurably greater gap in the Annals, not to mention that it is
just as possible that this small space may have been after all only
intended to indicate the beqinninq of a new paraqraph! We there-
fore conclude that even in the absence of any exter-nal evidence,
the assumption of a lacuna will be methodically justified, if we can
adduce weighty internal grounds in its favor. Happily these are
not wanting.

The speaker of c. 36 had pointed out that the development of
the splendid eloquence of republican Rome was directly conditioned
and stimulated by the anarchical state of affairs which then existed
(horum quoque temporum oratores ea consecuti sunt quae composita
et quieta et beata re publiea tribui fas erat tamen illa perturbatione
ao licentia plura sibi adsequi videbantur, cum mixtis omnibns et
moderatore uno carentibus). This is the very cornei-stone of his
argument, and he therefore, lest it be lost sight of, repeats it in the
very next chapter (c. 37 29 f. sed ut subinde admoneo, quaestionis

¹⁶⁸ It will also be noticed that both sentences, at the beginning and the end
of the lacuna, are complete in sense, which disposes of another objection (made
by Peter, Wolff, and others) to the effect that the grammatical completeness of
the two sentences in the Dialogus (c. 41 7) militates against the assumption of a
lacuna. As a matter of fact, gaps would be far more easily overlooked in such
cases than if the sentence broke off in the middle, as it does in c. 35 ext. So
e. g. in Plaut. Most. 940 A alone reveals the existence of a lacuna.
