330 NOTES.

0. 20 8 adfluens. But this interpretation places the emphasis upon
a very secondary element in the thought. Translate : For there is
nothing of respect in a school-room, into which all (toacher and
pupil) who enter are equally ignorant, nothing of progress in the
pupils themselves etc.

With the exception of sed (set) which was corrupted out of est by
metathesis (cf. crit. note c. 12 14), the much disputed passage appears to
me perfectly sound. John, followed by Wolff, writes ‘ut in quem . . .
intrat‚⁷ but has to have recourse to a ‘Erneuerung eines altlateinischen
Gebrauchs ’ like ‘sunt qui with ind.⁷ (!) and to a ⁴ Freiheit des Modus des
Tacitus.' The other emendations proposed seem to me equally improbable
and unnecessary.

10 cum pueri etc. Quint. II 2, 14 shares the same view: pueros
adulescentibus permixtos sedere non placet mihi. nam etiamsi vir
talis, qualem esse oportet studiis moribusque praepositum mo.
destam habere potest etiam iuventutem, tamen vel infirmitas a
robustioribus separanda est et carendum non solum crimine tur-
pitudinis, verum etiam suspicione.

11 pari securitate i. e. there is no one present who by virtue of
superior attainments could accurately and properly criticise the
work done. Cf. Quint. ΙΙ 2, 9-13.

12 contrariae? The very exercises themselves run counter to
the intellectual needs of the pupil, the practical aim of his training
being lost sight of. —nempe enim: ‘for as you all know! Nempe
simply strengthens ³enim.' This collocation is found in Plautus
e. g. Trin. 61 (So RitschL Trin. Proleq. p. 75 for the MS. reading
‘namque enim ⁷) and was revived in Silver Latin. Cf. Quint. ΙΙ
13, 9 VIII prooem. 6 Plin. Ep. III 16, 8 Pan. 62. In Tacitus
only here. For analagous pleonasms, cf. e. g. itaque ergo (Ter.
Eun. 317 Liv. XXVIII 12) ita sic (Liv. II 10) deinde postea (Cic.
Tusc. Disp. IV 1, 2) Tac. G. 10 et illud quidem etiam. Cp. Kiihner

13 rhetoras: On the Greek acc„ see note 0. 30 4. -suasoriae et
controversiae: Suasoriae belong to the genus deliberativum (συμ-
βουλευτικόν), controversiae to the genus iudiciale (δικανικόν). The
epideictic branch is here omitted, because rhetoricians regarded its
treatment as unimportant and beneath their notice. Cf. Quint. ΙΙ

iudicialesque materias (nam cetera ut professione sua minora de-
