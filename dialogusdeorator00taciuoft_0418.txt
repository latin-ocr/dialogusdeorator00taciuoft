274 NOTEs.

6 maiores tuos: Messalla was the only native Roman in the
company and hence ‘maiores tu03,’ used as a synonym of ‘ antiqui'
(cf. c. 25 5 sive illos antiquos sive maiores sive quo alio mavult
nomine appellet), is appropriately applied to the great orators of
the Republic whom Aper had criticised so unsparingly. John and
many others understand the allusion to be to MessaHa's ancestral
relative, Messalla Corvinus, but this view is erroneous, for it is
(1) incompatible with the answer ³ non suin offensus Apri mei dis-
putatione,' which includes Aper's entire argument. (2) Aper had
expressly disclaimed any intention of attacking Corvinus (c. 21 ext.)
and while the reasons for this abstention are not particularly com-
plimentary to the ancient orator, it does not necessarily follow
that Messalla would have resented the criticism. (3) The plural
‘maiores' cannot refer to one distinct and definite individuaL the
parallel instances‚ cited by John from c. 34 3 and Cic. pro Mil. 7,ss
in monumentis maiorum suorum being in no sense analogous.-
lacessendo: On the instrumental abl. of the gerund, cf. c. 11 6.

‘Apri mei' seems to me a more methodical correction of the MS. reading
6 a prima' (aprini) than ‘Apri‚’ which leaves the origin of the corruption,
unexplained. Cf. c. 5 ext. Maternum meum. ‘Nostri' which is also an
easy emendation, seems less suitable to the context. —— 6 nani nec ' or 6 nam
et ⁷ is quite unintelligible and probably due to the false solution of a com-
pendium. Andresen writes Apri nostri disputatione nec mea vos, but this
is too violent a correction, the antithesis between 6 nostri ' and 6 mea ' being
also uncalled for. See Steuding, p. 10.

8 si quid forte· - · perstringat: ‘if ought perchance grate upon
your ears.' si forte with subj. also c. 33 32 si forte audierint H.
III 66 nisi forte . . . gerat IV 74 nisi forte . . . speratis. With the
phrase itself‚ cf. c. 9 5 licet haec ipsa . . . aures tuas respuant. and

 

Hor. C. II 1, 18 perstringis aures. So similarly Ann. Ι 13 Q. Hate- .

rius et Mam. Scaurus suspicacem animum (sc. Tiberii) perstrinxere.

9 hanc esse eius modi sermonum legem: In this phrase, Tacitus
again unintentionally reveals the fictitious character of the Dia-
logus. Cf. c. 14 20 28 5 32 {za—iudicium animi etc. : ³ To give ex-
pression to one's convictions without the fear of injuring another's
feelings.' “ Adfectus ' occurs in the same general sense in c. 23 25
sic exprimitis adfectus and H. I 15 Ann. XI 38 XIII 16. 21. In
c. 6 17, in the more concrete signification of ‘ emotions.' I can sec
no reason for taking the word here as an epexegetic genitive.

10 citrazsine. Very frequent in post-Aug. authors, particularly
in Quintilian, but in Tacitus only in the minor writings. Cf. c. 41
