suffered 111 consequence. Cf. Sen. de remed. fort. 12, 4 Η. 81 muti

maduerunt rostra pusilli. Secundus had admitted in 0. 37 19 ff. that
the superior eloquence of the ancients was but a poor compensation
for the anarchical conditions Which alone had rendered its growth
possible. This is true, rejoins Maternus, but it should also be
added, that not even these orators themselves were allowed to enjoy
the fruits of their reputation, for they all met with a violent end.
See Andresen ad loc.

27 pensare = compensare is post-Aug. Cf. 0. g. Vell. II 88 prae-
maturam mortem immortali nominis sui pensavit memoria and
often. In Tac. in this sense only here. On the simple verb for
the compound, cf. note c. 1 18.

Maternus had occupied himself (0. 40) with an examination of the argu--
ments of Secundus, which 110 had drawn from the political conditions of
the Republic (c. 36-37 ext). Beginning with 0. 38, Secundus discussed the
constitution of the law-courts. Accordingly Maternus, following the same
order of topjcs‚ proceeds with a consideration of the statements in this
second part of Secundus' speech. This symmetrically elaborated antithesisv
and the constant polemical allusions to subjects touched upon in c. 38 (see
the following notes) are, in my Judgment, absolutely inexplicable on the
theory that Maternus was the speaker throughout. Cp. Proleg. p. lxxx ff.

41. 1 quod superest antiqui oratoribus fori etc. This is in
answer to the words of Secundus c. 36 5ff. horum quoque tempo--
rum oratores ea consecuti sunt, quae composita et quieta et beata
re publica tribui fas est, where 800 note, alluding at the same time-
to c. 38 10 omnia in foro . . . quod maius armamentum est etc..
What little of forensic pleading, Maternus replies, still remains to-
modern orators, for causae centumvirales‚ as we have just been
told, now hold the first place (c. 38 211) and are tried in ³ auditoria*
