etiam forte circumfusae multitudinis compositi non ferunt illud
intentionis silentium : nec sibi diserti videntur, nisi omnia tumultu
et vociferatione concusserint—tot pariter ac tam nobiles etc.:
The anaphoric ‘ cum ' clauses analyse the composition of the great
audience which faced the orators of the Republic on important
occasions. The higher (nobiles) and lower classes (clientelae,
tribus), of the city and the representatives of municipalities
crowded the foruni, and took a personal interest in court trials.
John and Andresen strangely contend‚ that we must supply 111
thought ‘ oratores' or ³ advocati⁷ after ³ nobiles,' the former under-
standing the large number of patroni present, but as these never
exceeded twelve (see note c. 38 5) ‘ coartarent’ would be a ridic-
ulous hyperbole. nobiles as a noun in the sense of the higher
classes or “ patricians⁷ is exceedingly common in Tac. : G. 25 H.
11 38. 92 Ann. I 2 II 11. 56 III 55 ΧΙ 23 XIII 16. 18 XIV 53.
On substantived tot, see note c. 8 25.

17 tribus: i. e. the commonalty, the poorer classes. So Plin. N.
H. XIX 4, 19, 54 111 herbis aliqua sibi nasci tribus negant, caule in
tantum saginato, ut pauperis mense capiat Mart. VIII 15, 4 ditant
Latias tertia dona tribus Flor. ΙΙ 6, 25 equitem imitatae tribus.
-Observe the symmetry of collocation ε clientelae quoque ac tribus

. . etiam legationes ac pars Italiae, each of the two members
joined by ‘et' being made up of two elements joined by ‘ac'3 quoque
joined to the first member of the first group corresponding to
‘etiam' 111 the first member of the second group. Cf. note c. 17 12
and the passage from the Agricola cited below.

Halm was, therefore, wrong 111 writing ‘tribus ac’ on the authority of
the reading in B.

18 pars Italiae etc.: Cf. Tac. Ann. XIII 4 consulum tribuna-
libus Italia et publicae provinciae adsisterent.—adsisterett The
predicate in Tac. often agrees with the nearest subject in the sing,
even if a preceding subject is in the plural. Cf. e. g. Ag. 24 solum
caelumque et ingenia cultusque hominum haud multum a Britannia
differt G. 27 sua cuique arma, quorundam igni et equus adicitur
