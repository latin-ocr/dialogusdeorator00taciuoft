restricted signification which Secundus gave to it in the preceding para-
graph, in which case all reference to Maternus' splendid contribution would
be entirely wanting in Messalla’s answer. But (1) no valid reason has been
or can be adduced why the speaker could not have used ‘sermo’ in the
same sense as in his introductory remarks (= ‘conversatiom discussion’),
the more so, as the subtle distinction made between ‘sermo’ and ⁶ oratio'
by Secundus is not confirmed by general Latin usage. Cf. Quint. II 21, 1
sermo quacunque de re compositus dicitur oratio XII 10, 44 aliam videtur
habere naturam sermo vulgaris, aliam viri eloquentis oratio Victorin. Ι.
p. 242 H. sermo philosophorum, dictio oratoris, oratio autem potest et ad
dialogum convenire si sit paulo splendidior Rhet. ad Heren. 111 23 sermo
est oratio remissa et finitima cotidianae locutioni. The qualities which
Cic. Orat. 19, 64 demands of an ‘oratio' as distinguished from ‘sermo’ are
certainly as abundantly found in Aper's speech as in that of Maternus, nor
can the former's argument be legitimately characterised as being ‘finitima
cotidianae locutioni ’ (cf. e. g. the figurative language in c. 5. 6 ext. 9 med.
10 med.), and yet Andresen quotes the last two passages himself in support
of his view. (2) The addition of ‘et oratio’ necessarily involves the further
change of ‘ adfecisset ' to ‘ adfecissent,' for a singular verb after two substan-
tives joined by ‘et—et' is extremely rare (see note c. 22 20), and permis-
sible only if one of the subiects were entitled to the greater emphasis3
but this would, in the present instance, be open to the identical objection
which prompted Andresen to insert ‘et oratio.’ Finally‚ it may be re-
marked that the emendation in question lacks all palaeographical probae
bility. Cp. Am. Jour. Phil. XII 336 f.

quae fingentur, quam simillimae veritati et declamatio, in quantum
maxime potest, imitetur eas actiones in quarum exercitationem re-

a forensibus causis existimant, ii profecto ne rationem quidem, qua
ista exercitatio inventa sit, pervident (See ΙΙ 4, 41 Sen. Contr. Ι
praef. 12). These ² exercises⁷ moreover, were held both in private
and in public. Cf. Sen. Contr. III 12, where Cassius Severus gives
among his reasons, why his ‘declamationes’ were inferior to his
forensic speeches: adsuevi non auditorem spectare sed iudicem
and esp. 18 vix iam obtineri solet, ut declamem (i. e. before a large
audience) illud obtineri non potest ut velim aliis quam familiaris-
