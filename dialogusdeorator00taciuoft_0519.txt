and ‘ tabularia' (c. 39 5), rather proves, that we have not yet
reached 311 ideal state, though we may admit that a more regulated
order of things now prevails.

The emendation ‘antiqui . . . fori ’ is eminently satisfactory, being both
easy and admirably suited to the meaning called for by the context.
Andresen, following Brotier and Ritter, inserts ‘ ex’ before ‘antiquis ' and
deletes ⁶ forum ³ or ‘horum' of the MSS. Nothing can be more unjustifi-
able on methodical grounds. Andresen refers in his latest edition to his
Emend. p. 134, but nothing more than the mere conjecture itself is there
given. Apart from the manifest inferiority of his reading to the one
adopted in the text, I have serious doubts, whether ‘superest ex aliquo'
can be supported by parallel passages, nor do Ι, 111 any case, understand
what is meant by ⁴ what is left of ancient orators '! Maternus is speaking
of condition-s, not of individuals. ——— ‘superest antiquis oratoribus forum‚'
accepted by some, absurdly implies that, in the speaker's opinion, there
were still orators of the old type (‘Redner des alten Schlages') remaining,
a point refuted by the entire treatise.
