140 NOTEs.

Ch. 11-13. Maternus, in reply to Aper, points out that the alleqed
uselessness ofpoetry was not exemplifled, in his ease, at least, for one
of his own early dramas had been the primary cause of riddinq the
eommonwealtlt of tlte powerful Vatinius, a success attended with qreater
reputation than could have been won 'in the law courts, and as for
tlte eaeternal triumphs of tlte orator, by which, Aper laad laid such
store, they offer no sufficient inducement to the speaker to alter liis
fioeed resolution⁴ to bid farewell to forensio duties forever (— c. 11).
A contemplative life, on the other hand, passed amiel tlte solitude of
tlte silent ⁸(Jroves, instills a deep and lastinq joy. Poetry was, in fact,
tlte lanyuaqe in which eloquence first clotlzed itself, and from the
earliest period its devotees were beloved of the ¹qods and the kinys of
tlte earth, and their fame was ever as qreat as tlie renown aequireol
by the orator (— c. 12). The anaeieties and tribulations, moreover,
inseparable from an orator⁷s career, wlzen compared with the honored
and tranquil freedom vouclzsafed to the disciple of the Muses, fully
justify his determination to pass the rest of his days under their
beniqn protection (— 13 ext).

11. 1 Quae cum dixisset: Again c. 24 1 quae cum Aper dixis-
set. In the historical writings, ‘cum' is supplanted by ‘ubi,' in
similar phrases. Cp. WVoelfflin, Pkilol. XXV 119. — acrius, ut sole-
bat, et intento ore: aerius ‘earnest' opposed to remissus, (Cf. Cic.
Brut. 92, 317 Cotta et Hortensius, quorum alter remissus et lenis
. . . alter acer) pertains to the manner3 intento ore opposed to
subridens, to the speaker’s facial expression, although intentus is
also used of the attitude of fixed attention. Cf. Ann. VI 50 idem
animi rigor (sc. Tiberio) sermone ac vultu intentus, quaesita inter-
dum comitate XIII 3 triumphos maiorum enumerabat, intentus
ipse et ceteri . . . postquam ad providentiam sapientiamque flexit,
nemo risui temperare. Cic. pro Flacc. 11, 26 intentis oculis ut
aiunt, acerrime contemplemini de leg. agr. II 28, 7 7 intentis oculis
. . . intueri Prop. I 3, 19 intentis . . . haerebam ocellis Amm.
Marc. 29, 2, 23 incedebat intentis oculis et rigidis Min. Fel.
Octav. 39 intentos vultus tenebamus. Cp. Otto, Spriehw. s. v.

oculus (5) —— ut solebat, this elliptical use is very common in Taci-
tus e. g. H. II 61 Ann. I 24 II 39 III 1 VI 12 XIII 44 XIV 49

XV 20.
3 non minus diu: ‘at no less length, in an equally long speech!
