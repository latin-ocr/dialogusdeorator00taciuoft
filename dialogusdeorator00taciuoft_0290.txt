5 secedit animus: This sentence ought logically to have been
incorporated in the preceding ε Νο11 111 strepitu . . . reorum sed in
locis puris . . . sedibusque sacris componuntur. But the importance
which the speaker attaches to sylvan retirement as best suited to
poetic contemplation, caused him to add this idea, by way of promi-
nence, as a principal clause. Quintilian in a long passage (X 3,
22-33) takes direct issue with this view: Non tamen protinus
audiendi qui credunt aptissima in hoc nemora silvasque quod illa
caeli libertas locorumque amoenitas sublimem animum et beatiorem
spiritum parent, mihi certe iucundus hic magis quam studiorum
hortator videtur esse secessus . . . Namque illa, quae ipsa delectant,
11666886 est avocent ab intentione operis destinati . . . quare silva-
rum amoenitas . . . et ipsa late circumspiciendi libertas ad se tra-
hunt ut mihi remittere potius voluptas ista videatur cogitationem
quam intendere. These statements are sufficiently general to be
applicable to pursuits other than those of oratory, although Quin-
tilian primarily intended them for the latter.

a too strictly local sense. The anacoluthon, spoken of above,
caused ¹ haec ⁷ to be joined to ‘ sedes ' as its real antecedent, where-
as, in reality, it refers to the act of poetic composition implied
in the preceding clause, i. 6. poetry composed 611116 the woodland
seclusion of hallowed places is the earliest and holiest form which
