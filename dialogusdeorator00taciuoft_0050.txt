xlvi PROLEGOMENA.

Relegating the reader for detailed comment to my Notes and to ⁴

the chapter on ³ Style and Language,' I here content myself with
an enumeration of some of the more striking stylistic coincidences
between the Dialogus and the historical works of Tacitus.

a. The ‘happy audacity' with which Tacitus enriched the vocab—
ulary of the language⁹⁵ is already noticcable in the Dialogus,⁹⁶ th'e
following expressions being also found in the later works, but not
elsewhere: histrionalis (c. 26 9 29 11 Ann. I 16), clientulus (c. 37 2
Ann. XII 36), educationibus in the plural (c. 28 23 Ann. III 25)
and perhaps et— et after a negative (c. 5 5 34 11 Ag. 35).

b. Expressions invested with a new meaning and apparently not
elsewhere in prose: eura = ‘ liber' (c. 3 13 6 22 Ann. III 24 IV 11),
lenocinari (c. 6 24 G. 43), sacra = “ sacra loca' (c. 13 19 H. III 33
Ann. I 54. 79), inpeaea in a figurative sense (c. 20 10 and perhaps
Ann. XVI 10), coqitatio = ³ consilium ' (c. 3 13 21 21 Ag. 39 H. I 27
II 7 4 Ann. XV 54), incitamentum, an extremely rare word, except
in Tacitus (14 times), and not elsewhere used of persons (c. 40 11
H. II 23 Ann. VI 29), obviarn ire used in a non-hostile signification
(c. 41 19 Η. 1V 46 Ann. IV 6 XIII 5), inauditus in a legal sense
first found in Tacitus and, with two exceptions, always joined with
‘indefensus' (c. 16 14 H. Ι 6 II 10 Ann. II 77—Ann. IV 11 '
XII 22).

c. Expressions of very rare or not common occurrence in good
Latin prose met with both in the Dial. and the historical writings
of Tacitus: quisque with plural predicate (c. 1 17), utrique=‘uter-
que' (c. 2 6), modo . . . nunc (c. 3 16), qloria ‘literary fame' (c. 5 10),
mediocritas (c. 7 4), inqero ‘din into the ears' (c. 7 14), notabilior,
honorificentius, audentius (c. 812 9 9 18 7), ἀπὸ κοινοῦ construction
of relative pronoun (c. 8 24), dare =¹ dedere' (c. 8 30), concessive
ut (c. 9 18), vanescere (c. 10 24), ullus as a noun (c. 12 14), adj. with
inf. (c. 16 11), sita for ² posita' (c. 18 2), use. of quodsi (c. 19 15), etsi
non . . . at certe (c. 19 21), adfluens (c. 20 8), nisi quis—nisi qui
(c. 21 24), epexegetic que (c. 22 9), concessu: ‘ consensu' (c. 25 12),
ante —post ³ superior—inferior to' (c. 26 31), numerare ‘esteem'
(c. 26 32), deleqari =³ committere⁷ (c. 29 1), habere =‘ continere ⁷

Differenzen auf Verschiedenheit des Verfassers schliessen‚ statt sich des Gliickes
zu frenen, dass uns von einem denkwi'irdigen, schriftstellerischen Entwicke-
lungsgange die beiden Endglieder wie die Mittelstufen erhalten sind.'’
