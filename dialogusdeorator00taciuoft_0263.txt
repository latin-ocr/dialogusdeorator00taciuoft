very doubtful. Varro L. L. VII 36, in his na'l've way, derived it
from versibus viendis. Moderns generally connect the term with
Irish saith. Gr. φάτης, Lat. fari, fabula are different. Mommsen,
Hermes XVI 620 note 4 supposes a Gallie origin, on the basis of

The purist Tacitus never use's ‘poeta' except in the Dialogus,
where it could not well have been avoided. See also note on sapi-

10 deducit, salutat, prosequitur, are all more or less technical
terms. Deduoere is to escort the statesman or orator from his home to
the forum or the senate >as a mark of honor or respect, -more rarely
in the sense of reducere “ to accompany back to his house.' Cf. Cic·

synonymous with ‘adsectari' in the general sense of ‘accompanying,'
as in c. 2 7 quos . . . in publico adsectabar, or perhaps better taken
as the opposite of deducere (de domo). Cf. Gell. XVIII 1, 16
prosecuti Favorinum in domum, and Ann. XI 12. Andresen and
Wolff take prosequi to mean ³ to accompany on travels,' but as the
impoverished Bassus (c. 9 25) was not likely to travel extensively,
Aper’s remark would savor of facetiousness, bordering on sal-casm.
