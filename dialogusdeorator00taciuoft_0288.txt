144 NOTES.

On the thought, cf. the very similar passage in Cic. ad fam. I 9, 23
nam etiam ab orationibus diiungo me referoque ad. mansuetiores
Musas. (See 0. 13 17.) Here ‘deiungo‚' if joined to ‘orationibus,'
would be too bold a metaphor and out of place in this particular
context. Hence the very easy emendation is not permissible.

13 comitatus · · · egressus · - · frequentiam salutantium: With
reference to Aper's words (c. 9 9 f.), 'comitatus' corresponding to
‘prosequitur,' ‘egressus' to ‘deducit,' and ²freq. saL' to ‘salutat’
Cf. Tac. Ann. XI 12 11011 furtim sed multo comitatu domum, egres-
sibus adhaerescere.

salutantium is an evident emendation for salutationum. Cf. Sen. Ep.
19, 11 turba salutantium and 0. 13 22.

14 aera et imagines: Hendiadys‚ equivalent to ‘clipeatae ima-
gines, bronze medallions,' on which see note c. 8 25.

15 nolente: The partic. form (usually in the abl.) is post—
Augustan. Cf. Lucan Ι 274 nolente senatu Quint. ΙΙΙ 6, 68
sermonibus me nolente vulgatis. —in domum—inruperunt: Inrum-
pere, in the sense of ‘to force an entrance into,' is elsewhere in
Tacitus invariably construed. with the accusative, as occasionally
also in pre—Aug. Latin. Cf. H. IV 50 domum consulis inrumperunt,
Caes. B. C. III 111, 1 domum eius i. Sall. J ug. 25, 9 portam. Cicero,
011 the other hand, never omits the preposition, and it is this usage
that the youthful Tacitus and his teacher Quintilian follow. See
Woelfflin, Philol. XXVII 138. Nipp. Ann. ΙΙ 11, Schmalz, Antib.
1 p. 730.

16 nam statum cuiusque· · - tuetur: Only the firm belief that a
pure character and honest convictions will insure immunity from
punishment can account for the certainly imprudent refusal of
Maternus to alter such passages in his plays as had given offenoe.
The generalisation, unjustifiable though it be (see below), is pre-
eminently suited to the poet’s optimistic nature. The entire pas-
sage is intended as an answer to Aper's general inquiry in c. 5
quid est tutius etc.? No doubt eloquence is an admirable defensive
weapon, but it is far preferable not to be called upon to use it,
and the speaker, for the reason given, does not anticipate such a
contingency. Cf. also Cic. Hort. fragm. 66 sufficere ad gloriam
bene facti conscientiam.

This interpretation requires only the insignificant change of tueor into
tuetur. So videtur in c. 33 15 for videor. 39 2 rideatur (cm-w) ridear (AB).
