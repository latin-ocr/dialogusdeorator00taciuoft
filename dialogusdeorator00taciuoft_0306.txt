laeta viris. Insanus designates the senseless noise made by the
populace3 lubricum the uncertainty and danger attending forensic
pleading.

21 famamque pallentem: Fame is here said to cause paleness‚
because of the instability and transitoriness of forensia reputation,
which is wholly dependent upon the fickle favor of the populace.
For the thought, cf. Sen. Ep. 95, 57 f. Non contingit tranquillitas
nisi immutabile certumque iudicium adeptis : ceteri decidunt sub-
inde et reponuntur et inter intermissa adpetitaque alternis fluctu-
antur. Causa huius iactationis est quod nihil liquet incertissimo
regimine utentibus, fama.— For the metonymy (cause for effect),

John and Andresen take fama to mean ‘town-talk, popular opinion‚' on
the ground that ‘glory’ is equally sought both by orator and by poet.
But this interpretation conflicts with the character of the speaker as drawn
by Tacitus, for Maternus disdainfully ignores the gossip of the multitude
(see c. 2. 3) and by the use of the epithet ‘ pallentem' simply distinguishes
the ‘bubble reputation’ of the orator, acquired amid surroundings which
place him in a perpetual state of worry and excitementfirom the stable
and lasting fame vouchsafed to the poet. ‘ Palantem,' which John accepts,
would of course be a very suitable attribute of ‘fama' in the sense which
he erroneously attributes to it here.

trepidus: On the adj. for the adverb, see note c. 4 4.—-non me
---nec· · · excitet: ‘non' is used in place of ‘ne’ to emphasise
² me,' some phrase like ‘sed alii' being understood. Cf. Tac. Ann.
I 11 non ad unum omnia deferrent, where Nipp. also cites examples
from Cic. pro Cluent. 57, 155 and Liv. IX 34, 15. In the poets
(e. g. Verg. Aen. XII 78> and post-Augustan prose-writers this
usage is common. — For ‘nec' with the optative 01· hortative sub-
