Demosthene accepimus, ea aetate L. Crassus ostendit id se in
foro optume iam facere, quod etiam tum poterat domi cum laude
meditari. The defendant, C. Papirius Carbo (see c. 18 3), com-

mitted suicide before sentence was pronounced upon him (Cic. ad
fam. IX 21, 3 Brut. 27, 103 Val. Max, III 7, 6).

33 uno et vicensimo Caesar Dolabellam: Cf. Suet. Caes. 4 com-
posita seditione civili (i. e. M. Aemilio Lepido D. Iunio Bruto coss.

77 Β. c. Cf. C. Ι. L. Ι p. 439 Brut. 92, 317 f.) Cornel. Dolabellam
consularem et triumphalem repetundarum postulavit. This speech

(mentioned also by Ascon. in Scaur. p. 26 Or. Vell. Pat. II 43 Plut.
Caes. 4) established Caesar's oratorical reputation. Cf. Suet. Caes.
55 post accusationem Dolabellae haud dubie principibus patronis
adnumeratus est.

The MSS. all have nono decimo . . . L. Crassus etc., which date, as
Lambinus and Brotier pointed out, conflicts with the express testimony
of Cic. l. c. Nipperdey, Rhein. Mus. XIX 577 ff. <= Opusc. 323 ff), has,
therefore, substituted uno et vicensimo. That the trial of Carbo (see also
note c. 18 3) took place after his consulship in 120 Β. c. (C. I. L. Ι p. 534) is
clear from a comparison of Cic. de leg. 111 16, 35 and de orat. II 40, 170,
and as Crassus (see Cic. Brut. 43, 161) was born in 140 B. c., it follows that
he was not nineteen but twenty-one years of age in 119 B. c. —In the second
date the MSS. are again at variance with the facts, as Casaubonus and
Lipsius observed‚ for according to the unimpeachable testimony of Sueto-
nius 1. c., Caesar (born July 13, 100; see Violet p. 169) must have been at
least 23, not 21 years old, when he accused Dolabella. There can, there-
fore, be no doubt that the dates given in our MSS. involve two chrono-
logical errors, but the propriety or justification of emending the text ac-
cordingly, must be very seriously questioned, for apart from the intrinsic
improbability of two palpable errors in the MSS„ the corrections proposed
destroy the chronological sequence (19-21—22-24) evidently designed by
the author. Under these circumstances, we are forced to the conclusion
that the dates here given are due to Tacitus or rather to the source Which
he consulted. This is rendered the more plausible, as the chronological
data concerning the speeches of famous orators seem to have been of a
particularly conflictiny character, as we must infer from an interesting pas-
sage in Gell. N. A. XV 28, on which see Proleg. p. xcvii where some reasons
are also advanced for believing that Tacitus is directly indebted for the
erroneous information in question to Mucianus.

altero et vicensimo Asinius Pollio G. Catonem: C. Porcius Cato,
a relative of Cato Uticensis, was tribunus plebis in 56 and accused
by Pollio (born 76 Β. c.) for maladministration. He was defended
by Calvus and M. Scaurus and acquitted, July 3, 54 Β. 0. Cf. Cic.
