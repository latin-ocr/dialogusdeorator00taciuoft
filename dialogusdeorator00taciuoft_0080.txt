lxxvi PROLEGOMENA.

Materni extat sed haec omnia continenter sub Messallae persona
leguntur) Lipsius did not pursue the thought any further, nor did
he state his reasons, but he doubtless felt, as Lange and Steiner
did at a later period, that the closing words were somehow incon-
sistent with the previous utterances of Maternus,¹⁵⁷ a conviction
which subsequently culminated in Strodtbeck⁷s and Eckstein’s
interpretation of Maternus' closing address as ironical, a ‚suppo-
sition which obviated the assumption of a lacuna and allowed the
whole speech to be spoken uno tenore by the interlocutor whom
the MSS. expressly designate as the last speaker.

Lipsius' conjecture was universally rejected or ignored for nearly
300 years, until Steiner¹⁵⁸ endeavored to restore it to honor, only
differing from him in that he substituted Secundus in place of
Messalla, as the preceding speaker, partly because Messalla would
otherwise have monopolised the discussion of all the causes of the
decline of eloquence, partly because he was convinced that Secundus
could not have been so strangely ignored by the author. A lacuna
after c. 40 7 he rejected, because the MSS. do not indicate it.¹⁵⁹
Steiner found some support for Lipsius' view in a few dots which
Cyl-illus asserted were found between the words ‘utatur' and
‘finierat' in the codex Farnesianus (Ο).160 But even granting that
these problematical dots pointed unmistakably to a lacuna, Steiner's
theory, which has found no follower save Weinkauff (p. lxviii,
lxxxiv), falls to the ground, if it can be shown that the c. 36-42

sondern es ist die natiirliche (P) Fortsetzung des bis dahin erorterten politischen
Zustandes aus dem Munde einer und dev-selben Person. Diese Person aber,
welche jene politischen Ursachen der Beredsamkeit darlegt, kann Maternus
nicht gewesen sein,’ for the reason given by Lange. See note 157.

150 “interest spatium distinctum ac lacunam indicans.'’ Eckstein in
Walther's edition, followed by most critics, supposed this insignificantly small
space to have been left vacant “ad finem sermonis indicandum‚” while
Baehrens (C'omm. Urit. p. 99 note) thought ‘⁴ nil nisi litteram initialem omissam
esse scilicet a rubricatore addendam, id quod de Vaticano (A) quoque testatur
Michaelis ’' (viZ. inierat—F in margine minio picturus erat librarius). But the
very existence of these dots in C is doubtful. Michaelis is silent about the
Farnesianus, and no trace of any dots or vacant spaces is found in the other
MSS. in the place mentioned !
