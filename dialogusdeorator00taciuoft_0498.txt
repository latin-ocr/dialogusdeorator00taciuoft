The MSS. have ‘ secura velint‚' a reading universally rejected since the
time of Rhenanus. As John (Berl. Phil. Wochenschr. 1888 No. 46 and ad
loc.) has shown, an antithesis is imperatively called for. This fact in itself
disposes of the conjectures of Rhenanus and Walther. The remaining
emendations, with two exceptions‚ all imply a lacuna between ‘secura’
and ‘velint‚' not a very probable supposition. Against Baehrens’ and
Vahlen’s restorations, it may also be urged that the desire of seeinq others
in danger cannot be given as the cause of ‘altior et excelsior etc.‚' nor
does Lucret. in the famous passage of the second book (1 ff.)‚ which
would have to be regarded as Tacitus’ model, speak of desire but of satis-
faction: Suave mari magno turbantibus aequora ventis Ι 8 terra magnum
alterius spectare laborem. The passage cited by Vahlen from Sen. de ben.
IV 12, 2 abire in partem alteram possim et securus spectare aliena certa-
mina, at best but proves that the thought occurs elsewhere. Finally‚
Vahlen's and Halm's reading is too rhythmical (A. -, ,Ι- —‚ -Ι- ΙΙ uu,
,Ι- υυ, ,Ι- υυ, υ L) to be acceptable. The only emendation of the
many proposed (p. 50) which seems to me entirely free from objections and
in every way satisfactory to the context, is that of John, the remarkable
Greek parallelism cited above furnishing an additional argument of con-
siderable weight in its favor.

38. 2 veterum iudiciorum quae: i. e. quae forma iudiciorum.
veterum, though part of the grammatical antecedent, is excluded
by the addition of ‘nunc' A systematic search would doubtless
reveal numerous instances of an analogous inconcinnity in ancient
as well as modern writers. Cf. e. g. Nep. Paus. 3 non enim mores
patrios sed etiam cultum vestitumque mutavit (Andresen), Tac. G.
24 nudi iuvenes, quibus (sc. iuvenibus) id ludicrum est Overbeck,
Pompeji I p. 7 Die vei-haltnissmassig wenigen Skulpturwerke
Pompejis, deren Herculanum eine ungleich grossere Reihe bietet
(John) and so similarly below 1. 6 where see note. 0. 28 18 eiusdem
familiae suboles qua is not a case in point. Cf. note ad loc. An-
other instance occurs in Quint. X 1, 17 certius iudicium quod.

The reading of the Mss. est ita erit (est. . . E tuerit-v est ita [est]
erit) is unintelligible, but no plausible emendation has as yet been offered,
for ‘ extiterit' which has met with great favor, violates the consistent usage

of Tacitus which does not allow a subj. with ‘etsi' Cf. 36 4. 13 Ag. 5 G.
5 Ann. ΙΙΙ 46 V 3 VI 29. 45 XI 35. The same objection applies to ‘qua
etsi aptiorem statueris' which at the same time involves too violent a
change. ‘aptior est veritati ⁹ misinterprets Secundus' meaning, for, as the
following sentence shows, he does not regard the legal procedure of his
time as more fitting in the abstract, but only from a practical point of view.
Perhaps ‘existit’ (Bennett) or ⁴ extitit ⁷ represents the original reading.
