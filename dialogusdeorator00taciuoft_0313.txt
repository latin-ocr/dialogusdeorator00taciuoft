well ; what it does lack is the elevated and fervid tone of the poet, and
this distinction is very appropriately expressed by ‘ardention' The pas-
sages usually cited in favor of the MS. reading from Quint. X 5, 4 XII 10,
23 seem to me irrelevant, for in the latter ‘audax' refers to the orator
Aeschines, while the former pertains to bold translations of Greek words.

*poetarum quam oratorum similior oratio: poetarum quam ora-
torum orationum . . . oratio. An example of the so-called ‘ compa-
ratio compendiaria,' by which the property belonging to the person
or thing is directly compared with the person or with the thing itself.
This brachylogy is often employed to avoid the awkward repetition

. of the same word or the unidiomatic substitution of a demonstrative

pronoun. In Tacitus the construction is rare, e. g. G. 46 quae
omnia diversa Sarmatis (= moribus Sarmatarum) sunt. Ag. 24
solum caelumque et ingenia cultusque hominum haud multum a
Britannia differt. Cp. Dr. Stil p. 105. Quint. X 1, 31 est (sc.
historia) enim proxima poetis (=p0etarum operibus) Plin. Ep. Ι

Mayor to Iuv. ΙΙΙ 7 4. sermo Ι promptus et Isaeo torrentior (= Isaei
sermone). Especially common in Cicero. See Ellendt and Wilkins

ΙΙΙ p. 624 f. The ‘complosio syllabarum' noticeable in similior
oratio, does not find favor in the eyes of Quintilian (IX 4, 41):
‘videndum etiam ne syllaba verbi prioris ultima et prima sequentis
sit eadem. But in all save a few of the 32 instances in Tacitus
which Weinkauff p. 7 6 has collected, the conjunction of syllables
would have remained unnoticed by Roman ears, because of the
difference in quantity e. g. c. 41 12 minor oratorum c. 13 16 servi
videntur 36 1 flamma materia H. ΙΙ 1 decor oris. In Vix-gil and
ovid (see the examples in R. V. III 866 note 819, where also other
literature on this subject is given) both syllables, it is true, have
the same quantity, but Quintilian's criticism would not, even in
these cases, have been as fully justified as in Cicer0⁷s ‘invisae
visae' or ¹ fortunatam natam' quoted by him (l. c.) in illustration.

Et—atque, joining two clauses, is an intolerable solecism. Cp. Hand
Turs. Ι 529 5 Madvig de fin. p. 388³, and Dr. H. S. II 81, who is prac-
tically of the same opinion. Halm has, therefore, justly deleted ⁴ et' as a
dittography of the preceding syllable. Nevertheless, Andresen's suggestion
(Emend. 141 f.) to insert ‘ et oratio ³ has met with great favor (Peter, John,
Wolff). It is based upon the assumption that ‘sermo' must here have the
