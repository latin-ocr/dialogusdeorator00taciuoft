PREFACE

 

ΤΗΕ present edition of the Dialogus de Oratoribus was begun
as far back as 1888. Since that time I have spared no effort

but at the same time succinet and lucid, treatment of all the
interesting and difficult problems which the Dialogus ¹ presents‚
and I venture to hope that my solutions of them may convince
even those critics who have hitherto espoused other views
or drawn different conclusions from those advanced in the
succeeding pages.

The Adnotatz'o Oritica aims at completeness, no emendation of

recensio, being omitted3 the readings of subsequent editions
are, for the convenience of the student, also added. My text—
critical attitude and the arguments for the readings received
into the text are fully set forth in the chapter on the MSS. and
in the Critical Notes.

In writing the Eoeeyetieal Commentary I have constantly kept
in mind-the golden precept of Seneca: “Quo ducit materia
