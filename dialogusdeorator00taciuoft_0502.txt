perusal, a supposition sufficiently refuted by the example of Pollio,
the loyieal consequence of ¹ adeo splendore aliorum iudiciorum . . .
ob1·uebantur,⁷ expressed by the consecutive ‘ ut ' clause, can only be
that such speeches never existed„ The evident meaning of the
passage is, therefore, this ε ‘The splendid rewards which awaited
the talented orator in great public trials, rendered him so com-
pletely indifferent to cases tried before the Centumviri, that as a
natural consequence of this apathy, we do not read of the delivery
of any speeches of eminent orators before this court, excepting
Pollio's speeches for the heirs of Urbinia etc.' For this extremely
rare passive use of Zeqor with the infinitive‚ cf. Prop. V 11, 36 in
lapide hoc uni nupta fuisse legar Cassiod. Var. IX 3 extr. gryphes
aurum iugiter leguntur effodere. It will also be observed that the
interpretation just given disposes of the alleged inconsistency
which Vahlen (Prooem. Berl. 1881 p. 10) and the commentators
find in the construction ‘ab ipso tamen Pollione,' in place of ³ ipsae
tamen a Pollione, ‘and even Pollio himself (who is throughout the
Dialogus counted among the ‘magni oratores antiquorum ') con-
stitutes only an apparent exception to the practice of Cicero, etc„
as his speeches for the heirs of Urbinia were delivered at a time
When etc.' On the nom. c. inf. in Tac. see Dr. Stil p. 63.

from Quintilian who refers to this trial repeatedly : IV 1, 11 VII

hic sit ex Urbinia natus Clusinius Figulus ⁷ and esp. VII 2, 26 ut
in lite Urbiniana petitor dicit, ‘Clusinium Figulum filium Urbiniae
acie victa, in qua steterat, fugisse, iactatumque casibus variis,
retentum etiam a rege tandem in Italiam ac patriam suam Marru-
cinos venisse atque ibi adgnosci': Pollio contra, ‘servisse eum
Pisauri dominis duobus, medicinam factitasse, manu missum alienae
se familiae venali inmiscuisse, a se rogantem, ut ei serviret, emp-
tum.' This ancient Tichborne trial seems to have been a cause
ce'lebre and Pollio's speech was probably excerpted in the collec-
tion of Mucianus, whence Tacitus also took the date.
