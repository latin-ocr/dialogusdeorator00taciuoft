know.' In c. 21 15 quid ? ex Caelianis orationibus nempe, the
particle affirms the truth of a statement. In c. 35 12 finally nempe
simply strengthens enim. Cp. the exhaustive article in Hand,
Tursell. IV 154-165, also R. V. III 292 note 433 John ad loc. —
si-si-si-denique: A similar anaphora in. G. 7 si prompti, si conspicui,
si ante aciem agant. Cic. de orat. Ι 49, 212. Sen. Ep. 37, 3 si-si-si-
denique si. On this rhetorical figure, see Weinkauff p. 81-85
Volkmann, Rhet. p. 468.

11 negotium is regarded by the commentators as equivalent to
³ negotium forense ⁷ (so c. 14 16 Quint. I 12, 7), as in Quint. IV 2, 2¹7
XII 9, 8 and in Tacitus c. 19 26 38 9 Ann. II 27 IV 15 XIII 4
XVI 22. But as Aper, with admirable urbanity, suppressos the
real object of Bassus' consultation of a lawyer, it will be preferable
to take negotium also as an intentional euphemism. Translate:
³ Should he become involved in some difficulty ⁷ or ³ meet with any
trouble.' This meaning of ncqotium occurs in all periods of the
language e. g. Plaut. Men. V 9, 13 Poen. I 2, 30 Cic. ad fam. III 10, 1
de off. III 31, 112 Quint. V 12, 13 and note to c. 3 20.

12 recurret: ‘Will have recourse to! Very rare in this sense
for the regular decurrere. Cf. Quint. Prooem. 17 ad auctores
recurrere, I 6, 13 ad eam rationem recurrunt. Here practically
equivalent to curret, for in Tac., as in Silver Latin generally, re· in
composition is often merely intensive. Cf. G. 30 plus reponere in
duce quam in exercitu. Ann. XIII 57 residentibus flammis XV 73
revictam coniurationem. See also note c. 7 19.

13 non quia—neque ut: In place of ‘neque ut pro eo versus
facias,⁷ we expect some such phrase as ³ sed ut pro eo dicas, causam
agas, eum defendas.' The slight anacoluthon was occasioned by
Aper's reluctance to allude, save by implication, to the possible
contingency of a troublesome lawsuit in which Bassus might figure
as the defendant. On similar constructions in Tacitus, cf. H. III 4,
10 suadente Cornelio Fusco non quia industria Flaviani egebat, sed
ut consulare nomen . . . praetenderetur, and the examples cited by
Clemm, p. 128 f.—According to Nipp. Ann. XIII 1 (where see also
Furneaux’ note), the indicative is used after ³non quia‚' when a fact
is admitted to be true or likely to have been true, while its influence
upon the ensuing result is denied. So H. III 4 (above) Ann. XV 60.
Cf. note to c. 37 28, where we must read fuerit (with Madvig) for
fuit of the MSS.—domi nascuntur: A proverbial phrase. Cic.
