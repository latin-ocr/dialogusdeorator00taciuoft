244 NOTEs.

18 visum et oculos: The concrete term joined by ‘et ' to the ab·
straet, on which see note 0. 9 1. This view is well confirmed by the
use of‘ ac ⁷ in the collocation immediately preceding, for ‘ imbrem
ac ventum' expresses two distinct ideas, ‘visum et oculos' but one.
As the clauses are also antithetical and otherwise structurally
symmetrical, this change of conjunctions would be inexplicable‚
were it not for the reason just given.

19 supellectili: In the same figurative sense of oratory in Cic.
Orat. 24, 79 f. verecundus erit usus oratoriae quasi supellectilis.
supellex est enim quodam modo nostra quae est in ornamentis, alia
rerum alia verborum de orat. Ι 36, 165 in oratoris vero instrumento
tam lautam supellectilem numquam videram Sen. Ep. 88, 36 occu-
patus est in supervacua litterarum supellectili.—The form in ‘i'
is expressly approved of by Char. Ι 14. cp. however, Neue, Formenl.
Ι2 240.

20 sit in apparatu eius et aurum et gemmae: Two subjects desig-
nating similar ideas often take a sing. predicate, especially when
the verb precedes and this, even if one of the subjects is in the
plural. Cf. H. Ι 15 inrumpet adulatio, blanditiae ΙΙ 78 datur tibi
magna sedes, ingentes termini IV 42 securum reliquerat exul pater
et divisa inter creditores bona. A verb, however, agreeing in the
singular with the nearer of two subjects joined by ‘et—et' is
extremely rare. Ι am able to cite but two other instances viz.
Cic. pro Mur. 7, 15 et proavus Murenae et avus praetor fuit ad
Att. IV 17, 3 et ego et Cicero meus flagitabit. These exceptions
may be justified, however, by the fact that both nouns are kept
distinct in thought. The same is true of our passage, as is clear
from what follows, ‘sumere in manus' referring more particularly
to ³ aurum’3 ¹ aspicere ' to ‘gemmae' After et. . . et . . . et we have
the sing. in c. 38 19 where see note. Cf. also c. 6 20.

21 libeat: The indefinite subject is easily supplied. Cp. note 0.

 

9 22 Cic. de orat. Ι 8, 30 (cited as de orat. 25, 83 by Peterl) II 56, ¹

228 de fin. ΙΙΙ 21, 70 Tusc. Disp. IV, 11, 26. 20, 46 Lael. 16, 59,
where see Seyff.-Mu11. Hor. Sat. Ι 1, 3 Quint. X 2, 24. 7, 4
XII 7, 7.

22 oblitterata et obsoleta: Cf. c. 8 3 remotis et oblitteratis Cic.
de orat. ΙΙΙ 37, 150 illa laus oratoris ut abiecta atque obsoleta
fugiat Verr. ΙΙ 1, 21, 56 nimis antiqua et iam obsoleta Quint. IV 1,
58 ab obsoleta vetustate sumptum.
