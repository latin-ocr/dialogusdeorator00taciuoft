M. Aper.

lxx PROLEGOMENA.

MARCUS APER, known to us only from the Dialogus, is 0 111011 of
a quite differentstamp. Born in some Gallic 1111111101110111157,189 not
particularly favoredstffl perhaps neglected by the central govern-
ment, he seems to have emigrated at an early age to the imperial
city.¹¹ss Having acquir-ed a thorough rhetorical training and an all-
round education, he soon succeeded, in spite of the obstacles thrown
in the way of a novus homo from a distant province, in reaching
the praetorship. But he too does not seem to have long survived
the debate in which he is given so conspicuous a part, at all events,
he was dead when Tacitus composed the treatise, as is evident from
0. 2 5f.1⁴2 He is not mentioned either by Quintilian, who pays
so glowing 0 tribute to Secundus, or in Pliny's correspondence, and.
his name does not appear in our lists of the Roman consuls.

Aper exhibits all the sels-satisfied complacency and pride of the
successful sels-made man, and is naturally an enthusiastic advocate
and staunch supporter of the existing political regime, under which
he was enabled to rise from obscurity to affluence, influence and ’
fame. His views are thoroughly utilitarian3 wealth and power
command 1118 respect and admiration, regardless of the moral worth
of their possessor. ³ Corriger la fortune ' is his motto. A man of
a combative and polemical nature, a shrewd lawyer, he does not
shrink from casuistry, exaggeration and even misrepresentation, if
it suits his purpose.

, Η18 oratorical ideal is that of the modern school, as represented

Uebel aus dem unschatzbaren Gut eines festen inneren Friedens fliesse; in dem-
selben Sinne in welchem Tacitus selbst (see p. xli and note 67) . . . die Klage
iiber die Gegenwart zu massigen pflegt. I cannot afford to discuss the aberra·
tion of those critics who hold that the attitude of Maternus in the closing part
of the Dialogue is 111-0001101101)Ιο with his views in the opening Chapters, an
opinion which reached an absurd climax in the contentiori of Strodtbeck that
the closing utterances of the poet must be regarded as purely ironical !

141 He had also been in Britain, as we learn from 0. 17 17, but whether this
visit antedates his departure for Rome or whether he went there in some official
capacity subsequently, cannot be ascertained. The latter seems to me on the
whole the more probable.

142 See p. xxvi. The suppositionthat he possibly left Rome shortly after 7 5,
never to return, is in my judgment quite incompatible with the attitude of a

man whose very being was so intimately bound up in the city of his adoption, ’

and whose appreciation of the rewards of oratorical success, possible only in a

- large city, was so keen as that of Aper. See c. 6 and 9 ext.
