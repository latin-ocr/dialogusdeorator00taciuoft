notes 16 and 17, he enumerates more than 70 readings of ΟΔ, or 0
alone, which flatly contradict his own assertion. Steuding there-
fore contended that ΟΕΔ go back to a common source, their coinci-
dences with D being, according to him, due to the lost codex ω,
postulated by Michaelis. But Steuding’s view was in turn dis-
carded by Binde (1884), who, so far as one can make out from his
confused presentation, endeavors to establish a closer relationship
between CADE, more particularly CAD, the various discrepancies
being the result of a series of peculiar cross-contaminations.²²² His
investigation virtually resulted in proving what had never been
denied, namely, that the MSS. of the Y class represented a tradition
distinct from X, while the various members of the former group
were in turn bound to another by ties more or less close.

Three years before Binde, E. Baehrens, in his edition of the
Dialogus, had advanced still another theory as to the interrelation·
ship of the Y class of MSS. (p. 45 fi), asserting, rather than actually
proving, that Δ and E were directly derived from Y (designated by ,
him, for no apparent reason, as M), the former occupying the same
rank among the Y class, that A does in the X (N) family.²²⁸ OD, on
the other hand, Baehrens regarded as descendants of a lost MS. x,
a brother of ΔΕ, G having been copied before a: had been subjected
to a revision, by which fact he would account for the coincidences
of D with AB. His family tree is represented by the following

It was reserved for F. Soheuer22⁴ to demonstrate that the con-
flicting theories which Michaelis, Steuding, Baehrens and Binde
had propounded, are all alike untenable. But apart from the
negative value of his dissertation, -he has, by the introduction of a
new witness, the cod. Vindobonensis, succeeded in discovering the
