simo 18, 50 homo in primis ingeniosus et in dicendo exercitatus.
Cf. also Brut. 56, 205 Sulpici orationes quae feruntur, eas
post mortem eius scripsisse P. Canutius putatur, aequalis meus,
homo extra nostrum ordinem meo iudicio disertissimus—Arrius:
This is the reading proposed by Gronovius on the basis of a passage·
in Cic. Brut. 69, 242, in which one Q. Arrius, in spite of his
oratorical mediocrity, is dealt with at some length, which draws
from Atticus the impatient remark ‘tu quidem de faece hauris.'
He was praetor in 72 B. c. and was appointed to succeed Verres,
but remained in Italy on account of the slave war in which he took
a prominent part. He is probably the same individual mentioned
by Plut. Cic. 15 Κόϊντος Ἄρριος, ἀνὴρ στρατηγικός. He was defeated.
for the consulship (59 B. c.) and appeared as the opponent of Cicero
in the trial of Milo (52 Β. 0.), but was himself accused, probably de
ambitu, in the same year.-Furnius: He was identified by Gro-
novius with an orator of that name in Cic. ad fam. X, 25. 26 ad Att.
IX 6, but, according to Hieron. Chi-on. ad ann.. Abrah. 1980 s36 B.c.,
there were two Furnii, father and son, both distinguished orators.
The father, a friend of Cicero and opponent of Antony, is frequently
referred to in Cicero's correspondence and elsewhere, and is very
probably the person alluded to by Aper. His eloquence, in striking
conti-ast to the low opinion expressed of him here, is extravagantly
eulogised in a passage of Plut. Ant. 58 Φουρνίου δὲ λέγοντος, ὃς ἦν
ἀξιώματος μεγάλου καὶ δεινότατος εἰπεῖν Ῥωμαίων.-Το1“8.Π1Π8ἒ Only ‘bWO
of the three or possibly four contemporaries of Cicero of that name
are available, but we know too little of ‘chem to arrive at any even
adequately plausible identification.

4 in eodem valetudinario ‘ infirmary' sc. ὄντας or versantes (iacen-
tes or laborantes—Weinkauff). On this ellipsis of the participle, cf.
note c. 9 20. The phrase was proverbial. Cf. Sen. Ep. 27, 1 tam-
quam in eodem valetudinario iaceam de communi tecum malo
conloquor Hor. Sat. II 3, 121 maxima pars hominum morbo iacta-
tur eodem. So similarly in Greek e. g. Zenob. 3, 56 εἷς ἀσθενοῦντα
ἀσθενῶν ἐλήλυθα Eusbabh. p. 1757 τὴν ἐμὴν κάμνεις νόσον. —ob haee
ossa et hanc maciem: Rhetorical 01· stylistic characteristics are very
frequently illustrated by metaphors taken from the human body,
particularly its arms, sinews, muscles, bones, flesh and blood. Cp.
the long list of examples given by Mayor, Quint. X 1, 33. 60. For
especially elaborated instances, see e. g. c. 21 33 Quint. VIII pr. 18 ff.
