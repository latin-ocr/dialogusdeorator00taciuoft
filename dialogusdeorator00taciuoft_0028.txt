xxiv PROLEGOMENA.

fovet. Centum et viqinti anni ab interitu Ciceronis in hunc diem
colliguntur, unius hominis aetas.) Now in adding up the various
items, it was found, that the sum total only amounted to 117 years
(43 B. c. -— 74ss 5 A. D.). As Maternus repeats Aper's statement in
almost identical language (c. 24 ext.) and as ‘in hunc diem' was
taken to mean ‘ down to this very day' (Dec. 7. 43 13.c.—Dec. 7.
74 Α. n.),²³ the discrepancy appeared so glaring as to be explicable
only on the assumption of a textual corruption. But as the number
120 was fixed by the repetition mentioned and as the completed
reigns of the emperors cited, are known to be indisputably
historical,²⁴ the error was supposed to lurk in the last item, and
accordingly critics have vied with one another in correcting the
writer's faulty arithmetio. Their conjectures, enumerated on p. 21,
have deservedly failed to carry conviction,²⁵ and hence the great
majority of modern scholars were forced to resort to the expedient
of taking 120 years as a round number, a supposition which does
not account for the elaborate enumeration preceding.

Ι am convinced that the difficulties hitherto discovered in the
passage under notice are imaginary, for the statement ‘centum et
viginti anni etc.⁷ neither expresses an exact nor an approximate

2³ We are not only under no compulsion to take ⁴ in hunc diem’ in this sense,
but there are also weighty reasons against its being so interpreted. (1) It is not
easy to understand how Maternus could have referred back to Aper’s computation
more accurately than by repeating his own words, a device met with elsewhere in
the Dialogue. Cf. e. g. c. 9 ext. and 12 1, c. 24 ext. and 32 22, c. 36 5 and 40 7'.
(2) The demonstrative pronoun ‘hie,’ esp. when joined to time designations, is
exceedingly common in the sense of ‘the present, now existing,’ (3) ‘Down
to this very day ' would have been correctly expressed by ‘in hunc ipsum diem.'
(4) An exact interpretation of the phrase involves the absurd assumption that
the author of the Dialogus intentionally placed the debate on the anniversary of
Cicero's death (Dec. 7), a supposition sufficiently refuted by prope quadriennium.

24 This applies also to the duration of the reign of Augustus, although the
MSS. give 59 years in our passage, by which the beginning of his reign is made
to antedate the assassination of Caesar ! Lipsius has therefore justly changed
the number to 56, for Suetonius, Dio Cassius and Tacitus himself date the reign
of Augustus from the year 42]ss B· c. while others took the battle of Actium
(31 13.c.) as a starting point. The error in our MSS. is simply due to the hap-
hazard attempt of some ancient scribe or reader who wished to bring up the sum
total to 120.

2⁵ Andresen in his latest revision of Nipperdey's Annals, Einleit. p. 7, actually
proposes in all seriousness to delete ‘sextam iam ’ altogether! But no conceivable
motive can ever have induced a mediaeval scribe or reader to interpolate so

definite a statement.
