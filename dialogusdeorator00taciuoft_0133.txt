text-critical importance, and are of interest only because they bear
valuable testimony to the interrelationship of our MSS„ to which
problem we may now turn our attention.

b. The Interdependcnce of the MSS.

The discussion of this difficult subject cannot be said to antedate Michaelis.
the appearance of Michaelis' edition (1868), which for the first
time presented an accurate picture of the character of our extant
MSS. Michaelis having, upon very slender grounds, as we shall
see, pronounced in favor of the superior validity of the X class
(AB), argued that D, which often forsakes its family for the read-
ings of AB or B alone, must be regarded, in spite of the carelessness
with which it was written, as the most trustworthy apographon of
the archetypon of Y. O' he placed next in value, but inasmuch as
it often agrees with E, where D coincides with AB, he concluded
that the variants in OE must be due to interpolation and conjecture,
and not to the common parent of DOE. E, Michaelis asserted, was
a direct offspring of C, but as it in turn frequently coincided with
A as against C, these divergences could only be explained on the
hypothesis that it had been subsequently corrected out of A οι·
some member of this family. Finally, Δ is brought into close
relationship to C, both having been copied from a brother of D.
Michaelis’ stemma is therefore this:
