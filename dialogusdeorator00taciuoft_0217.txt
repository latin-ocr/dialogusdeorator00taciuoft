c. 3. 73

tant part in the Thyestes of Maternus, the tragedy cannot have
dealt exclusively with the celebrated cena Thyestea, but must
have also included the later phase of the story in which Aga-
memnon and Menelaus, now grown to man's estate, capture Thy-
estes at Delphi, whence he is brought back to Argos and thrown
into prison3 Aegisthus sent in to murder the prisoner is recog-
nised by him as his own son. There follows the suicide of Aerope
and the subsequent assassination of Atreus while sacrificing at the
altar. Cf. Hygin. Fab. 88. This story certainly offered ample
opportunities for the eloquent harangues of Agamemnon unmistak-
ably alluded to by Aper. It was dramatised by Euripides in the
Θυέστης, by Sophocles probably in the Θ. δεύτερος and perhaps also
by Accius in the Pelopidae. —In like manner, the Atreus of Scau-
rus contained covert attacks upon the emperor Tiberius. Cf. Tac.
Ann. VI 29: nihil hunc (sc. Scaurum) amicitia Seiani sed labefecit
haud minus validum ad exitia Macronis odium qui easdem artes
occultius exercebat detuleratque argumentum tragoediae a Scauro
scriptae additis versibus qui in Tiberium flecterentur. Dio Cass.
58, 24 Ἀτρεὺς μὲν τὸ ποίημα ἦν παρῄνει δὲ τῶν ἀρχομένων τινὶ ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ
κατὰ τὸν Ἐυριπίδην ἵνα τὴν τοῦ κρατοῦντος ἀβουλίαν φέρῃ (Phoen. 396)
τὰς τῶν κρατούντων ἀμαθίας φέρειν χρεών. By way of contrast With
the behaviour of Maternus, we may compare the story related by
Sen. Contr. 10 praef. 8 of T. Labienus: memini aliquando, cum
recitaret historiam, magnam partem illum libri convolvisse et dixisse
‘haee quae transeo post mortem meam legentur.'

12 intra me: Cf. Ann. XIV 53 ut plerumque intra me ipse vol-
vam IV 40 ipse quid intra animum volutaverim Quint. XI 3, 2
quae intra nosmet ipsos composuimus—ipse: Tacitus invariably
places ipse in the nominative when joined to an oblique case of
the personal or possessive pronoun. Cf. c. 3 20 tibi ipse . . impor-
tasses 7 1 de me ipse fatear 15 7 ipse tibi denegares 12 mecum
ipse conquiro 36 23 sibi ipsi persuaserant 37 36 sibi ipsa desump-
serit. Ag. 1. 46 Η. Ι 46. 85 II 44. 50. 76 III 16 IV 11. 20'.

18 XIII 26 XIV 9. 37. Observe also that this pronoun is always
postpositive with but one apparent exception in c. 15 7, where
see note. On this much discussed idiom, cp. Nagelsbach‚ Stilist.
