PROLEGOMENA. xxix

ingenia sed tu mihi (ita similitudo naturae ferebat) maxime imita-
bilis, maxime imitandus videbaris 1

And this man, it is seriously contended, was not likely, at the
age of 27, to have had any desire to discuss or the requisite intel-
lectual equipment and maturity to fathom a problem which must
needs have suggested itself to every educated observer of the liter-
ary characteristics of his time! But, if we must assume that
Tacitus could have had no scruples in calling himself ‘iuvenis
admodum' with reference to the days of his forensic apprentice-
ship‚ inasmuch as he even styles himself ‘ iuvenis‚' at the beginning
of Domitian's reign‚⁸⁴ is the phrase itself properly applicable to a
youth of 21 ⁴? There is not the slightest doubt of it, for words
designating time of life are of an extremely elastic nature in
Latin.⁸⁶ Finally, even supposing that the term ‘iuvenis admodum'
were more consistently used in Latin than it is, and had been
rigidly confined to the 17th or 181311 year,²³⁶ Tacitus, we contend,
would still have had a very strong motive for intentionally pre-
senting himself as younger than he actually was, in order to
account for the certainly strange circumstance that he, though

⁸⁴ Ag. 3 tot annis (1. 6. 81-96 A. 1).), quibus iuvenes ad senectutem (at the age
of 421) . . . per silentium venimus. Cp. also Ag. 9 consul filiam iuveni mihi
despondit (77 A. D.).

*ὅ Thus e. g. Nepos (Att. 8, 2) speaks of Brutus as ⁶ adulescens ' at the age of
37, of Hamilcar and Eumenes as ⁴ peradulescentes,’ when 21 years old. Sallust
(Cat. 3) styles himself ‘ adulescens ’ at the age of 34, and Caesar (Cat. 49) at 36
‘ adulescentulus.’ Pompey in his 24111 year was still ‘ peradulescens‚' according
to Cic. (pro leg. Man. 21). Cicero himself was ‘adulescens’ at the age of 26,
when he defended Roscius (Orat. 30, 107), and Gell. XV 28, 5 in speaking of
the same trial uses the phrase ‘admodum adulescens! Crassus when 21 years
old is ⁴ adulescentulus ' and ‘ admodum adulescens ' (Cic. de off. II 13, 47 Brut.
43, 159). In Cic. Phil. V 17, 48 we read ‘superior Africanus, T. Flamininus
admodum adulescentes consules facti. Vell. Pat. ΙΙ 41, 3 styles Caesar when 24
‘admodum iuvenis‚' and Quint. (XII 6, 1) finally goes so far as to designate
Demosthenes at the age of 21 as ‘ admodum puerum ' 1 Cp. also Eckstein p. 37
Haase p. XVI note 62 Weinkauff p. XXIX. XLIII. CLVII Jansen p. 34 f.

⁸⁶ Cp. Nipp. Andr. Einl. Ann. p. 7 “ Denn friihestens ist diese Bezeichnung
wohl fiir das 17te J ahr anwendbar‚ mit welchem die toga virilis angelegt wurde3
wie weit sie aber fur das spatere Alter ausgedehnt werden konnte, wird sich bei
dem Schwankenden, dass alle Altersangaben dieser Art haben, kaum bestimmen
lassen.” It is very remarkable that Andresen‚ who so strenuously objects to
the phrase ‘admodum iuvenis‚' should have allowed the above words 10 stand,

although he quietly omitted other equally important passages from Nipperdey's
original introduction. See note 29.
