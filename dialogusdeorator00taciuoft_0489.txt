bant II 5. 84 III 8. Besides the historica] compilations here
cited, he was the author of another work (Travels in Syria ?)‚ from
which Pliny (and perhaps Josephus) has preserved some very
untrustworthy information. Cf. Teuffel ἓ 314, 1 and L. Brunn, de
Ο. Lia. Muc. Leipz. 1870.

8 ut opinor does not express any genuine doubt as to the actual
number of books already published‚ but simply serves to avoid an
air of learning in what purports to be an i‘nformal conversation
between friends. Cp. note c. 32 27.—A0torum libris: ‘Aetas as
the context shows, must not be taken in its technical sense of
Acta populi, or acta senatus, publica, diurna, urbana ὑπομνήματα,

Suppl. III 5 pp. 558-632, but as a general title, virtually equivae
lent to ‘Actiones’ (cf. c. 17 22 32 11). The work of Mucianus
probably contained an epitomised selection of the more noteworthy
speeches delivered in the assembly, the senate, the forum and the
law-courts, with sundry biographical and chronological notes of
interest, and it has been plausibly conjectured that many of the
oratorical fragments preserved in Gellius, Fronto and Macrobius
were taken from this identical compilation. To the same source, I
am disposed to attribute the information given in c. 34 ext. and the
learned item in c. 38 15 f. where see notes and cp. also Proleg. p.
xcvi—tribus Epistularum: These were probably miscellaneous ex-
cerpts similar to the ‘ Electa' in 160 bks. made by the elder Pliny
(Plin. Ep. III 5, 17). Cf. also Fronto, Ep. ad Antonin. 2, 5 (p.
107 N.) memini me excerpisse ex Ciceronis epistulis ea dumtaxat,
quibus inesset aliqua de eloquentia vel philosophia vel de re publica
disputatio; praeterea si quid eleganti aut verbo notabili dictum
videretur, excerpsi.
