We have no criterion to decide between ‘ cogitant‚' the reading of the X
class, and ⁴ cogitare‚’ of Y. The former, however, looks suspiciously like
an attempt to round off the sentence. -— ‘ nihil’ is preferable to ‘ vel ' (AB),
because more in keeping with the ἦθος of the passage. It is also supported
by the Ciceronian parallel. ‘ vel’ may have arisen out of ‘ nil.’

ch. 36-40 7. After the conclusion ⁰f Messalla's speech, Secundus
continues tlte discussion hy drawinq attention to tlte fact that one of
tlte chief causes of tlte decline of eloquence may be found in the un-
trammeled freedom ⁰f speech, and action enjoyed by democratic Athens
and republican Rome. In those days of popular autocracy, oratorieal
ability was the only means to political honors, and tlte frequent sen-
sational trials of illustrious defenderS, conducted in tlte inspirinq
presence of qreat multitudes, could not but yive an additional impetus
to the development of a superior eloquence. Finally the very) mode of
ἱεραί procedure, in the days of the Roman Republic, with. its liberal
time allowance and its publicity, was also Itiylzlqs conducive to tlte
yrowth. of oratory. This happy state of affairs is contrasted with tlte
deplorable restrictions placed upon tlte orators of tlte speaker’s time.
The qreat chansye was, it is admitted, tlte inevitable historical result
of a monarcltical re‘qime, but tlte tranquillity and order thus· secured‚
however desirable in themselves, were necessarily subversive of tlte
very conditions essential to oratorical eaecellence.

36. 1 magna eloquentia sicut flamma ete: This beautiful simile
was perhaps suggested by Cic. Brut. 24, 93 Quem (sc. Galbam) for-
tasse vis non ingeni solum sed etiam animi et naturalis quidam
dolor dicentem incendebat efficiebatque, ut et incitata et gravis et
vehemens esset orati03 dein cum otiosus stilum prehenderet motus-
que omnis animi tamquam ventus defecerat, flaccescebat oratio . . .
ardor animi non semper adest, isque cum consedit, omnis illa vis
et quasi flamma oratoris exstinguitur.

The evidently intended climax seems to me 'rudely destroyed, if we
accept the MS. reading ‘ urendo clarescit.' Andresen translates ‘erglanzt
im Verzehren’ (so similarly Peter) and adds by way of explanation ‘wie
die Flamme dann zugleioh am hellsten glttnzt, wenn sie am verheerend-
sten (l) austritt' etc. 1 cannot admit either that this is physically true or
that ‘urendo' can have this meaning. In my judgment, the brightness of
the fire is the immediate effect of ‘motibus excitatur,' in which case the
thought ‘⁶ and it brightens as it burns '' is but an otiose repetition which Ι
am loth to attribute to the author. The proper climax is brought out by
the easy change of ‘clarescit' into ‘calescit‚’ i. e. ‘Eloquenee like fire is
