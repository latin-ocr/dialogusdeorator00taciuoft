lxxxiv PROLEGOMENA.

ancients is, in perfect keeping with the cautious nature of the man,
brought out in a negative way by his contentiori that the moderna
did not enjoy the essential conditions which made the oratory of
the past what it was. The prerequisite clement of a direct and
irreconcilable antagonism between the two eminent teachers of
Tacitus is therefore wholly and significantly wanting, and hence
there existed no motive for including Secundus in the ² criminatio,'
with which Maternus and Messalla 011 the one side, and Aper, their
equally fervent opponent, on the other, good-naturedly threaten
one another in parting.
Summing up the previous discussion, we conclude that, after
Messalla had finished, Secundus followed in a speech, and that he
in turn was succeeded by Maternus, who brings the entire debate
to a close. But the beginning and end of Secundus' speech, the
end of Messalla's, and the beginning of that of Maternus are lost
in the two lacunae (c. 35 ext. 40 7) which unfortunately disfigure .
the closing portions of the treatise.
Tne lacuna There remains the vexed question as to the probable extent and

ning in the middle of a sentence.

Of our MSS, only the X class (A and B) seem at first sight to
furnish a definite clue to the exact size of the gap, both stating

that siae paqes were missing. But unfortunately the Dialogus takes
up 16 pages in A and 29 in B, which proves that the words ‘sex
pagellae' were simply copied from their common source,¹⁶⁹ now lost,
so that we are still ignorant as to the actual dimensions of the
page in the original archetypon. Egger¹⁷⁰ maintained that nine
pages had been omitted, basing his calculation upon the worthless
cod. Parisiensis 7773, but his premise is a pure fancy, and has justly
been rejected by Habbe ¹⁷¹ (p. 8). His own attempt, however,
though ingenious, rests upon no firmer foundation, as he operates
with two undemonstrable assumptions. He tacitly takes it for
granted : (1) That the number sim was found in the margin of the
cod. Hersfeldensis (2) That the codd. Med. 47, 36 6116. 68, 1, con-
taining respectively the letters of Pliny and Tac. Ann. V <V Ι), and
written by the same hand, were copied from a codex miscellaneus,
comprising also the Dialogus, the Germania and the Suetonian
