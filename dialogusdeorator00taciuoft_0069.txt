PROLEGOMENA. lxv

the previous conversation. Messalla expresses his sincere delight
on learning that his friends, as indeed befits men of true culture,
employ their leisure hours in discussing subjects not directly con-
nected with their profession, and compliments the eminent lawyer
Secundus for his historica] researches, while Aper, no less illus-
trious as an advocate, is ironically praised for not allowing his
forensic duties to alienate him from the theoretical and scholastic
exercises of modern rhet01·icians.¹³⁰ This last utterance (otium
suum mavult novorum rhetorum more quam veterum oratorum con-
sumere), though apparently nothing more than a hai-mless, ironical
fling at Aper's fondness for the rhetorical practices of his time,
which Messalla held in very low estimation (see c. 35), is of para-
mount importance in the dramatic development of the Dialogue.
For, by calling forth Aper's rejoinder: Non desinis, Messalla,
vetera tantum et antiqua mirari, nostrorum autem studia inridere
atque contemnere . . . cum neminem hoc tempore oratorem esse con-
tenderes, the question which is to form the main theme of discus-
sion is with wonderfully artless art brought upon the tapis. It in
turn naturally leads to the desire of learning the reasons for this

*vast difference between the oratory of the past and the present

(c. 15 11 f.)‚ a differenee which, in Messalla's opinion, was not
brought about by any healthy progress, but by the gradual abandon-
ment of loftier standards. The conflict having thus been prepared,
and a distribution of the contesting speakers arranged, the debate
begins. Aper, who has to stand up single-handed against a united
opposition, opens the discussion (c. 16 14) by a casuistical argument
concerning the relative meaning of the term ‘antiqui' and its
proper applicability to the orators of the Roman republic, and then
passes on to a scathing indictment of its greatest representatives
and a glowing eulogy of the characteristic features of modern
eloquence.

Messalla thereupon takes up the cudgels for his beloved
‘ancients,' so disparagingly criticised by Aper, but, being recalled
to the main theme at issue, gives, what he regards as the principal
reason for the decline of eloquence. The close of his argument
is lost. The next speaker, who, as we shall show below, is
Secundus, supplements, according to the agreement made in c.

¹⁸⁰ Maternus is not likewise commended for the versatility of his interests‚
because, though he too was an advocate by profession, his poetical predileetions
were too well known to have special attention drawn to them.
