c, 13. 159

12 ad quorum exempla me vocas: Cf. c. 8. For the phrase, cf.
Plin. Ep. IX 2, 2 ad cuius' (sc. Ciceronis) exemplum nos vocas
Paneg. 58 non te ad exemplar eius voco Cic. Acad. Pr. 18, 56 me
ad Democritum vocas. —habent - - · concupiscendum: ‘What do
they possess that one might covet?' Different from the construc-
tion of ‘habere' with the gerundive, discussed c. 8 12. ‘ Concupiscen-
dum' here takes the place of the missing adjective ‘concupiscibilis'

13 quod timent an quod timentur: an ³ or perhaps.⁷ Usage in simi-
lar interrogative clauses leads us to expect ‘ aut ' (R. V. III p. 313
note 4421’) but “ an‚' as a disjunctive particle, is, according to Nip-
perdey's observation (Ann. I 13), more common in Tacitus than in
any other writer. Cp. Heraeus ad H. I 7 Gantrelle, Style de Tac.
5134. The same contrast is brought out in Tac. H. IV 42 nihil
quod ex te concupisceret, nihil quod timeret and in Sidon. Apoll.
Ep. V 7 (a locus classicus on informers) hi sunt quos timent, etiam
qui timentur.

14 ii quibus non praestant indignantur: As Marcellus and Cris-
pus are importuned for favors day after day (cotidie), they would
naturally findit impossible, even if willing, to grant all requests
made to them, and hence they necessarily incurred the hatred of
those who remained unnoticed. Cf. the quite similar statement
in Plut. Comp. Alc. eli Coriol. 235 C z οὔ γὰρ θεραπεύουσι τοὺς πολλοὺς
ὥς μὴ δεόμενοι τιμῆς, εἶτα χαλεπαίνουσι μὴ τυγχάνοντες . . .
ὥς τὸ χαλεπαίνειν μάλιστα μὴ τυγχάνοντα τῆς τιμῆς ἐκ τοῦ σφόδρα γλί-
χεσθαι φυόμενον.

Lipsius’ easy emendation has been uniformly rejected. Of those who
defend the MS. reading, some (e. g. Wolff) suppose it possible that the
author designedly introduced a paradox as a surprise for the reader, who
naturally expects a negative statement; others, like John, contend that
the emphasis is on ‘indignantur‚' but in that case some such reading as
Michaelis suggested would be necessary, which, however, is itself open to
palaeographical objections. Andresen, followed by Peter, conjectures ‘vel ii
quibus praestant indignantur‚‘ a sentiment more epigrammatic than true, as
is clear from Andresen’s own translation ⁴ selbst diejenigen, denen sie ihre
Bitten gewahren, sich beleidiqt fiihlen'! In all the passages, moreover, cited
by these scholars in support of this view (Tac. Ann. IV 18 Sen. Ep. 8, 32
Florus IV 2, 92 to which might have been added Tac. H. IV 62 Sen. de ben.
I 3, 1 IV 40, 1 Ep. 19, 11), it is invariably the expected repayment of an
obligation incurred that is said to render the gift irksome to the recipient.
But this idea is not expressed in our passage nor do the words of the text
lcnd themselves to such an interpretation.
