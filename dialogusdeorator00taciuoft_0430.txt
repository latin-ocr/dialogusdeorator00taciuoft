286 NOTEs.

‘sauciness' —per quae: sc. vitia. A neuter plural agreeing with
two or more abstract feminine substantives first occurs in Cicero
e. g. de fin. III 11, 39 stultitiam autem et timiditatem . . . esse
fugienda de nat. deor. III 24, 61 fortuna . . . quam nemo ab incon·
stantia et temeritate seiunget quae digna certe non sunt deo.
Thereafter not rare in Sallust (e. g. Cat. 31) and Livy (e. g. VIII
35, 4). Tacitus furnishes numerous instances‚ e. g. Ag. 31 virtus
porro ac ferocia . . . ingrata (omitted by Dr. H. S. I 182 Stil p. 15
and Nipp. ad Ann. I 46) Η. II 20 pax et concordia . . . iactata
sunt. III 19. 70 Ann. XI 16 comitatem et temerantiam nulli
invisa, saepius vinolentiam ac libidines grata barbaris Quint.
VI 2, 11 VII 4, 31. — On the use of the preposition, see note c.
19 22.—impudentia inrepit: The same metaphor occurs in Plin.
Ep. III 20, 8 est enim periculum ne tacitis suffragiis impudentia
inrepat.

I am unable to extract any meaning out of ‘sui alienique contemptus'
consistent with the context. The interpretations hitherto proposed seem
to me erroneous in substance and quite incompatible with the only possible
signification of the words themselves, for neither can ‘alieni' be taken in
the sense of ‘alienorum' (so Wolff) or ‘ aliorum‚' nor can ‘suin by the side
of ‘ alieni‚⁷ be anything but the neut. gen. sing. Peter, in all seriousness‚
takes the phrase to mean ‘⁴ die ganze eigene und fremde Individualitat ''!‚
while John and Andresen understand the reference to be to the spendthrift
habits of contemporary youth and to ‘their reckless incurrence of debts;
but I utterly fail to see how ‘sui alienique contemptus' can be made to
yield these meanings. Moreover‚ ‘running into debt ’ does not as such imply
any contempt of the wealth of others, unless it be taken for granted that
the borrower draws upon the resources of the wealthy with the avowed
intention of not repaying the loan. Finally, I cannot admit that the char-
acteristics in question are the psychological result of the previously men-
tioned qualities. ‘Sui alienique contemptus‚' I feel convinced, is simply
due to an interlinear or marginal gloss, just such as we should expect a
monkish scribe to have made. ‘Impudentia' here and again in c. 35 5
ludum impudentiae is designated as the ultimate outcome of certain kinds
of training.

10 in utero matris concipi: Cf. c. 7 10 in alvo oritur Cic. Tusc.
Disp. ΠΙ 1, 2 nunc autem, simul atque editi in lucem et suscepti
sumus, in omni continuo pravitate ...versamur‚ ut paene cum
lacte nutricis errorem suxisse videamur Suet. Ner. 1 vitia . . .
quasi tradita et ingenita and Gell. N. A. XII 1, 14 ff.

11 histrionalis favor = histrionum favor. ‘Passion for the
theatre.’ Tacitus is fond of using an adj. in place of an obj. genitive.
