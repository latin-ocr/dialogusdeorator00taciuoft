PROLEGOMENA. lv

· the entire historical works (105—115 A. D.) furnish scarcely more

than 50 genuine instances in all, the proportion being about 2 : 1 in
favor of the Histories, some particular groupings, however, occur-
ring repeatedly, e. g. discordia, turbae, dissensio, fama, laus, gloria,
nomen; quies, an, otium3 vires, arma, manus3 inauditus, inde-
fensus. The great majority of instances are met with also in the
minor writings, but the following collocations in the Dialogus are
exaetly paralleled only in the Agricola and Germania: metum ae
terrorem (c. 5 22 Ag. 32), tueri et defendere (c. 7 8 G. 14), nemora et
lucos (c. 9 32 12 1 G. 9. 10. 45), fortuitae et subitae (c. 10 31 G. 11),
yloria . . . honor (e. 12 14 G. 5), inqenium ae studium (c. 14 10 Ag. 3),
caeli siderumque (c. 16 29 Ag. 12), vi et potestate (c. 19 23 G. 42),
vim et ardorem (c. 24 2 Ag. 8), severitate ao disciplina (c. 28 11
G. 25), remissiones lususque (c. 28 20 Ag. 3), probitati neque modestiae
(c. 29 7 40 G. 36), anqustis et brevibus (c. 30 27 G. 6), oonsilio et
auctoritate (o. 36 22 G. 12), quies . . . otium (c. 38 17 Ag. 6. 21. 42).
Only about a dozen, finally, apparently lack an exact or analogous
equivalent, either in the other writings of Tacitus or elsewhere.¹¹¹

Lastly, attention may be drawn to the extensive use made of the
so-caned oratio bimembris and trimembris, which consists in the
more or less redundant amplification of a thought and evidently
serves the purpose of establishing a stylistic equilibrium or rhetor-
ical libration of clauses. Weinkauff (pp. 89-97) has with great
industry, though an excessive zeal, collected 315 (ἶ) alleged instances
of this usage from the writings of Tacitus. Unfortunately‚ by far
the greater number, especially in the case of those given under
oratio bimembris, exhibits no feature that might not be readily
paralleled e. g. from Cicero, Livy, and Pliny. They are, therefore,
quite valueless for purposes of comparison of the usage of the
Dialogus and the other writings of Tacitus. Nevertheless, there
remain not a few illustrations which, by reason of a peculiarity of
collocation, are not without some significance in the present discus-
sion. E. g.

a. The amplifyinq clause is preceded by a parenthetieal phrase .-

11¹ Cp. e. g. notes to veteres et senes (c. 6 11), iuvenes . . . adulescentes (c. 7 13),
paupertas et anqustia rerum (c. 8 12), notitiae ac nominis (c. 1111 36 18), poetis
et vatibus (c. 12 12), adfluens et vayus (c. 20 8), tristem et inpexam (20 10), ossa . . .
maciem (c. 21 4), lentitudinis ac teporis (21 26) locupletem ac lautum (c. 22 17), in
publicum et in commune (c. 26 29).
