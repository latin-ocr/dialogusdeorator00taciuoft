PROLEGOMENA. ciii

slight sels-contradiction of Tacitus, moreover, seems also to betray
an earlier source. The author makes Messalla say that the time-
*honored custom by which a young man would attach himself to
some great orator, had gone out of vogue in his day (c. 34 init), and
yet Tacitus represents himself in the introduction as eonforming to
this very practice 1 Now this discrepancy is at once accounted for
on the supposition that Tacitus is here simply echoing the views
of his ‘Quelle’ But be this as it may, deny, if you will, that
neither Chrysippus nor Varro was directly consulted, the fact that
the chapters on education are not entirely original with Tacitus
must nevertheless, on the strength of the evidence accumulated
above, be regarded as indisputable.

We have seen that the author of the Dialogus is under the great-
est of obligations to previous writers, notably Cicero, but in spite
² of this we cannot but admit that Tacitus, even in his youth, was
no servile imitator, but that he assimila-ted his borrowed material
in such a manner as to make it practically his own,2⁰2 admirably
succeeding in producing a work, homogeneous in construction,
artistically elaborated in its style, and bearing all the outward
indications of an original composition.

Both Dra-eger and Gantrelle accord a very niggardly treatment to the DialoguS,
Weinkauff's second part is wholly inadequate‚ and Boetticher, Lex. Tac. pp.
xxxix-cii is very incomplete and somewhat antiquated. The above synopsis
aims at no scientific arrangement, but is merely designed to give a tolerably
complete survey of the stylistic usage of the Dialogue, in a conveniently tab-

ulated form. An asterisk refers to the more detailed discussion in the Notes
