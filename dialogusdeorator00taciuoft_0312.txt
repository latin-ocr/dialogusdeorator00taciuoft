168 NOTES.

406-425), but 'interveni' with acc. occurs only once z Tac. Ann. ΙΙΙ
23 cognitionem intervenerant, where see Nipp. and FurneauX.
These scholars take ‘consilium' with ‘tractantibus' (so e. g. Liv.
XXXIII 31, 7 consilia decem legatorum tractabantur) ; it is, how-
ever, equally possible to construe ‘interveni' both with consilium
and tractantibus, governing the impersonal object in the acc. and
the personal in the dative. Roth, John and Wolff in their transla-
tions tacitly adopt this interpretation. The inconcinnity is quite
Tacitean.—meditatio seems to be here used in the same sense as
‘scholastica controversia' (see 1. 24), μελέτη. Cf. Quint IV, 2 29
cum sit declamatio forensium actionum meditatio. It is opposed
to iudicia ‘actual pleadings in court! Cf. Quint. X 1, 70, where
the word refers to trial scenes enacted in the plays of Menander,
not ² speeches suitable to be made before a court’ as Peterson ad
loc. explains. The sudden introduction of a new speaker, preparae
tory to the taking up of a fresh topic of discussion, is a device
borrowed directly from Cic. de rep. I 11, 17 Haec Scipio cum dix-
isset, L. Furium repente venientem aspexit . . . tum Furius : ‘quid
vos agitis? num sermonem vestrum aliquem diremit noster inter-
ventus ’.θ’ ‘ Minime vero,⁷ Africanus5 ‘soles enim tu haec studiose
investigare' etc.

7 minime, minime: An instance of iteratio, ἐπίζευξις. Cf. Cic.
Cat. I 3 fuit, fuit Phil. II 22, 53 tu, tu. On this rhetorical figure,
common in both Greek and Latin, see Ioh. St1·aub,’ De tropis et
fiyuris . . . Dem. et Cic„ Progr. Aschaffenburg 1883 p. 114 f„ G.

See note c. 10 8.

9 accuratissimus: ‘carefully elaborated.' On this meaning of
³ accuratus,’ see note c. 6 20.

11 laeta: ‘ enthusiastic,' with particular reference to the tone of
the speech, as shown by ³ ardentior.' Of style Ξᾶνθηρός, see c. 22 6.

12 ardentior: ‘fiery, passionate,’ synonymous with ‘concitatus
(see above 1. 1), vehemens, fervidus) Cf. Cic. Orat. 38, 132 ardens
. . . oratio de orat. II 45, 190 nisi ipse (orator) inflammatus . . . et

ardens accesserit, and Causeret, Sur Za lamque de Za rhe'tor. dans

I fail to see on what grounds it can be said that the defence of a poet
ought to be more especially characterised by ‘audacia' than that of an
orator (cf. c. 18 7). As a matter of fact, the speech of Aper, whether we
examine its style 01· its subJ'ect-matter‚ merits the epithet of ‘ bold' equally
