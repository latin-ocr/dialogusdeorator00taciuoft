294 ’ NOTES.

Orat. 1, 2. The rule of Seyffert, Lael. p. 104-106 that ‘est’ takes
second place when it is the mere copula, but third place if it
denotes existence, is justly called into question by Muller and is
very decidedly refuted by our passage. The position, if not wholly
arbitrary, seems to be determined by the degree of emphasis called
for by the context.

25 exundat et exuberat: Doubtless suggested by Cic. de orat. I
6, 20 ac mea quidem sententia nemo poterit esse omni laude cumu-
latus orator, nisi erit omnium rerum magnarum atque artium
scientiam consecutus. Etenim ex rerum cognitione efflorescat et
redundet oportet oratio. Tac. uses these words in a figurative
sense also in Ann. XIV 53 tam lato fenore exuberat (sc. animus
meus) and III 72 exundantes opes. —admirabilisz Cicero repeatedly
contends that it must be the ultimate aim of the orator to render
his speech worthy of admiration. Cf. de opt. gen. 4, 12 quid?
dubium est, utrum orationem nostram tolerabilem tantum an etiam
admirabilem esse cupiamus ⁸? Quint. VIII 3, 6 recteque Cicero his
ipsis ad Brutum verbis quadam in epistula (not extant) scribit:
'nam eloquentiam, quae admirationem non habet, nullam iudico.
See also Sandys' note to Orat. 28, 97. In selecting this particular
epithet, therefore, Tacitus not only endorses Cicero's own view, but·
at the same time also pays a very high compliment to his oratorical
excellence.

26 orationis vis et facultas: Vis and facultas are frequently
combined. Cf. e. g. Cic. de orat. Ι 31, 142 Quint. XII 1, 33.

Andresen (Emend. p. 157 f.) objects to the reading ‘ceterae artes ’ as an
illogical correlative to oratoris, ‘rerum' in the sense of ‘ artium' being in
his opinion also inadmissible. The latter objection is abundantly refuted by
Cic. de orat. I 5, 19. 6, 20 (cited in previous note as the model of Tac.) 28,
128 III 22, 84 (quoted c. 32 11). The inconcinnity pointed out may be ad-
mitted; it is, however, paralleled by similar incongruities in the use of
‘ceteri ' and ‘alius' Cf. Tac. H. IV 56 legatis tantum legionum interfectis,
ceterum vulgus Ann. 1 31 III 42 (where see Nipp.) XV 37 Cic. Verr. Ι 1,
16, 47 Nep. Eum. 7, 1. The traditional reading might, therefore, be
plausibly defended. All difficulties, however, vanish at once, if we write
oracionis (an emendation curtly dismissed by Andresen) for ‘ oratoris.’ The
two nouns are often confused in the MSS. e. g. in Quint. I 10, 27 VI 2, 19 ’
X 2, 12 XII 1, 11. —The passages cited by Kleiber p. 30 and John ad loc.
in support of the collocation of ‘oratoris ' with ‘ vis' or ‘facultas' seem to
me quite irrelevant, as no antithesis with ‘artes' or ‘res' is either ex·-
pressed or implied in any of them.
