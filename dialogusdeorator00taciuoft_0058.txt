’ liv PROLEGOMENA.

The following words are common to the minor writings of
Tacitus, but not found in the later works τ adliqo (0. 13 15 G. 24),
ascendo in a figurative sense (c. 7 9 G. 25), attinet impersonal
(c. 25 31 Ag. 33), caementum (c. 20 25 G. 16), citra = sine (c. 27 10
Ag. 1 G. 16), colliqo = computo (cs17 16 G. 37), coqnatio (c. 25 23 G.
38), in commune = in publicum (c. 26 29 G. 27), concentus (c. 15 16
G. 3 virtutis c.), concito (c. 14 1 Ag. 38), confero ‘ discuss ' (c. 42 5
Ag. 15), contentio ‘ verbal encounter' (c. 4 2 Ag. 9), contactus ‘con-
taminated⁷ (c. 12 8 G. 10), conversatio =usus familiaris (c. 9 30 G.
30),¹¹⁰ cura ‘research⁷ (c. 16 3 Ag. 10), dominus sc. infans (c. 29 6
G. 20), fas est With‘acc. and inf. (c. 36 5 Ag. 46), lacertus (c. 10 23
G. 17), liniamentum (c. 33 3 G. 16 but in the non-tropical sense),
offensa (c. 3 5 10 30 and in the Histories3 in the Annals only offensio,
neither form appearing in the Agr. or Germ.), opinari (c. 2 10 G. 3),
positio (c. 16 29 Ag. 11), remissio (c. 28 20 Ag. 9). Cp. also the use
of cupido and cupiditas (c. 2 8), eliqere and deliqere (c. 10 32), the
frequency of abstract plui-als, use of neut. adj. sing. and plural for
nouns, perfect passive part. for abstract nouns, fut. part. for adj.
and many other examples commented on in the Notes and in the
chapter on ‘ Style and Language! Syntactical illustratione are
furnished by the usage of anastrophe of conjunctione and prep-
ositions, et before negatives, et in asyndetic collocations, change and
repetition of prepositions, the use of particles and the like.

The cumulative weight of this evidence in proof of a genetic
development in Tacitean style is considerable, but it is perhaps
most conspicuous in the decreasing frequency of synonymous col-
locations, discussed above, inasmuch as the fondness for such com-
binations 18 equally characteristic of many other writers, Quintilian
alone forming 0 rather remarkable exception, when we consider the
length of the Institutio. Now the Agricola (97 A. D.) still exhibits
64 instances of synonymic groupings3 in the Germania (98 A. D.)
there is a decided falling off, only 28 examples being found, while

110 It is curious to notice that Tacitus in the second part of the Annals occa-
sionally reverts to his earlier usage. conversatio is used in the sense of ‘con-
versation' in Ann. XII 49. Cp. also cum . . . tum (0. 5 6 14 19 Ann. XV 48),
damnari = improbari (0. 16 15 Ann. XVI 28), deneyo (c. 10 11 Ann. XV 42),
disciplina ‘instruction ' (c. 308 342 Ann. XV 52), divitiae (0. 8 27 Α1111. XVI 3
elsewhere ‘ opes ⁷), elementum τροπικῶς (0. 19 21 30 1 Α1111. XIII 3), erqo = igitur
(c. 34 1 G. 22. 45 Ann. XIV 3 XV 33), etsi non—at certe (c. 19 21 G. 33 Ann. XII
39), intentio (c. 14 3 Ann. XVI 34), licet concessive (0. 9 5 13 3 Ag. 32 Ann.
XIV 55), numerare (c. 21 35 G. 7 Ann. XV 41), percontatio (c. 1 7 Α1111. XV 58).
