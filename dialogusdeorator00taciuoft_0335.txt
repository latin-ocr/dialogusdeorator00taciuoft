o. 17. 191

22 potuit: The indicative of posse and debere in unreal condi-
tional clauses, is found in all periods of the language. Cp. Dr.
H. S. II 721 ff. Ki'ihner ΙΙ p. 930. In Tacitus ε Ag. 31 nisi
felicitas in socordiam vertisset, exuere iugum potuerunt. H. III 9
quodsi adfuisset fides . . . potuere IV 19 poterant, si . . . clausissent.
34 si . . . maturasset . . . potuit. See Nipp. Ann. I 42.—actio-
nibus: Lex. Tac. s. V. Wrongly interprete the word to mean ‘causae
privatae oratorum! The context shows, however, that ‘actiones '
signifies simply ‘orationes,' as again in c. 32 13 and frequently in
Quintilian e. g. X 1, 21. 22 (see Bonnell, LeX.) and Plin. Ep. II
5, 1 IX 13, 23. The word in this sense, like actor :orator (c. 26 7)
is post-Augustan, for the designation ‘prima actio in Verrem,'
cited by Peterson 1. c., is certainly not due to Cicero.

23 proximo· - · congiario: The name originally designated a
vessel that held a congius (about 3 qts.). It was subsequently
applied to largesses given to the people (cf. Quint. VI 3, 52 congia-
rium commune liberalitatis atque mensurae), or even to the soldiers,
though these gifts generally went by the name of ‘donativa' (cf.
Cic. ad Att. XVI 8 Curt. VI 8). Cp. Marquardt, Staatsverw. ΙΙ 132 ff.
Smith, Dict. Ant. I 528 f. —The ‘proximum' congiarium here
referred to is probably that distributed by Titus in the year 72 A.D.
cp. the inscription of a coin in Eckhel, Doctr. Num. VI 353 f.
tr. oAns. VESPASIAN. IMP. PONT. ΤΒ. ΡΟΤ. cos. 11. and on the obverse
concun. PRIMVM r. R. DAT. —plerosqum ‘ a number of! Cf. note
c. 2 10.

24 Divo quoque: The epithet 'Divo’ is here used as a proper
name. Cf. Ann. XIV 20 Gnaeum quoque Pompeium.

25 narrabant: The indicative is noteworthy only because the
subj. was used in a very analogous clause a few lines previous.
Uniformity could be easily restored by writing ‘fatebatur’ with
Baehrens or ‘narrarent’ here, but neither emendation seems neces-

sary. Cp. W. G. Hale Cum constr. p. 122 ff.

‘Nam . . . duravit.' This parenthetical clause is open to the gravest
obiectione, both internal and external. (1) ⁴ Corvinus in medium usque . . .
duravit' involves a gross chronological error which we cannot for an instant
attribute to the author, as Andresen is inclined to do, for Tacitus shows
himself fully conversant with the biographical data of Corvinus (cp. John,
correspbl. 1 p. 8 ff.). The middle of Augustus’ reign, which according to
c. 17 10 began in 43 B. c., was reached in 14 Β. c., but Corvinus was still
before the public as late as 2 A. n. (cf. Suet. Octav. 58), and he died six
