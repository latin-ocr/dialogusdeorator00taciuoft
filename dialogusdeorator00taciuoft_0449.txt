Some MSS.‚ both here and c. 30 20, where the same sciences are enume-
rated‚ exhibit the Greek endIngs (grammatice, musice, geometrice). But
Tacitus, very unlike Quintilian in this respect (see Bonnell Lex. Proleg.
§tx-XXVI), habitually avoids Greek forms and inflections, no less than
Greek words (on which see not-e c. 5 32), the only exceptions being perhaps
the name Oxionas (G. 46) and the quasi-proper name meyistanas (Ann.
XV 27), a word of Persian origin, signisying magnates. On ‘ rhetoras,' see
note c. 30 4.

34 imbuebantur, used of superficial training‚ as in c. 19 21 quin
elementis studiorum, etsi non instructus at certe imbutus, where

see note.

i. e. ‘For occasions may arise in which a superficial acquaintance

with the law is all that's desired‚ nay I may say, this will generally,
if not always be the case3 in many instances, however, also a
thorough knowledge of the above mentioned subjects will be neces-

explicari potest de orat. Ι 3, 10 ei scientiae (i. e. eius artis) 41,

‘incidunt' implies the idea of casual occurrence and hence ‘plurimae
quidem etc.' is added to prevent any misunderstanding of the speaker's
real meaning. ⁴ quibus iuris etc.‚’ the reading of all the MSS.‚ is clearly
distinguished from ‘in quibus’ below, for the law pertains to the entire
case, a knowledge οἱ music, geometry, etc. only to particular parts. Cp.
John ad loc. and note c. 21 32. Baehrens (C'omm. Crit. p. 88) understands
‘haec scientia' to refer to the knowledge of the law, and regards ‘notitia . . .
desideratur’ and ⁴ scientia requiritur’ as a climax, an interpretation which
he is unable to uphold without a number of arbitrary changes. Andresen,
overawed by the alleged difficulties of the passage, deletes the entire clause,
from ‘ incidunt-requiritur) It may be admitted that these words are not
essentia] to the context, but how a scribe ever came to insert, on mere
caprice, three lines, it were difficult to divine.

32. 1 sufficere ut is very rare. Cf. Plin. Ep. IX 21,3 interim
sufficiet ut exorari te sinas3 with ‘ne‚' ibid. 33, 11 and Tac. Ann.
