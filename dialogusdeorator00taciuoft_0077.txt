not help thinking that nature had rather marked him out for a .

scholar than for the active and less peaceful vocation of an advo-
cate, and hence we are not surprised to learn that he also devoted
himself to historical research, and had published an admirable
biography of Julius Africanus (c. 14 21 fi).

In the present mutilated condition of the Dialogue, Secundus
scarcely figures as an interlocutor at all. But that the author did.
assign to him a much larger share in the conversation seems to me
indisputable. For the conspicuous manner of his introduction, the
careful description of the oratorical characteristics of himself and
Aper, with whom he is placed upon a perfect footing of equality,
finally, the very phrase of the prooemium, ³ cum sinquli . . . causas
adferrent,' no less than the words in c. 16 8 pro duobus promitto:
nam et ego et Secundus exsequemur eas partes etc.,¹⁴⁸ render the
supposition that the author had nevertheless condemned him to
silence throughout the debate quite inconceivable. But whether
his contribution to the discussion was lost in the large lacuna after
e. 35, which has been the opinion of some scholars, or whether we
still possess part of it in the speech commonly assigned to Maternus,
is quite another and more difficult question, which we shall endeavor
to answer at the close of the chapter.

The fourth interlocutor, and the last to appear upon the scene, is
VIPsa-ANUS MESSALLA.¹⁴⁹ He was the only native Roman in the
cempany,¹⁵⁰ of illustrious family, and probably a direct descendant
of the famous M. Valerius Messalla Corvinus. This is nowhere

1⁴⁸ This unequivocal and positive promise of a speech by Secundus is quite
generally set aside as worthless‚ but Tacitus was under no compulsion to make
a purposeless statement, nor does an artist introduce a ⁶ motive' merely for the
sake os abandoning it at pleasure. It has also strangely been argued that
Secundus’ want of oratorical facility may well account for his not appearing as
an interlocutor. But this explanation utterly ignores the fact that the author
expressly attributes what he regards as an unjust accusation, to the maliynity
of some critics. If so, he had the more reason for exhibiting Secundus as a
fluent speaker instead of virtually confirming the charge by allowing him to
remain silent 1

¹⁵7 This is made evident not only by c. 28 9 vestra vobis notiora sunt: ego
de urbe et his propriis ac vernaculis vitiis loquar, but also by the fact that
he alone speaks of maiores nostri (c. 306 34 1 35 3), while Maternus, address-
ing Messalla, designates the orators of the Roman republic as maiores tuos
(e. 27 6).
