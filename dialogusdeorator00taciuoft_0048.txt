we again find a very pronounced family likeness, it being also a
peculiar characteristic 01 both authors that their prejudices against
the moral conduct of a man do not prevent them from doing full
justice to his intellectual abilities.⁸⁷

The same association of ideas, finally, is noticeable in certain
miscellaneous items,⁸⁸ particularly in utterances on the materi-
alistic character 01 101011310 oratory as compared with that 01 1110
past,⁸⁹ on the influence formerly enjoyed by oratorS‚⁹⁰ the pursuit
of philosophy ⁹¹ and the like. Everywhere “apparent liniamenta
eiusdem viri et vultus,⁷' but what is still more significant perhaps,
the entire treatise contains not a single thought that can be said
to have been repudiated or contradicted in the historical works of
Tacitus.⁹2

(d) The Stylistic character of the Dialoqus.

We have reached the last stage in our journey and are now prc-
pared to consider the argument derived from the style 01 1110
Dialogus, which constituted, as has been repeatedly remarked, the
one great obstacle in the way 01 a general acceptance 01 1110 treatise
as a genuine work 01 Tacitus.

⁹2 Ann. IV 61, cited 0. 6 25, is hardly a genuine exception, for although·
Tacitus may in his later years, as has been pointed out ad loc., have esteemed
extemporary effusions less highly, it must be remembered that in the earlier
passage he speaks more particularly of the pleasure afforded by improvisations,
whereas the passage from the Annals deals rather with the ephemeral character
of impromptu speeches.
