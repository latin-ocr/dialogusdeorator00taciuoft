Vahlen, Abh. Berl. Acad. Phia-hist. KZ. 1877 p. 15 note 1 and
especially the exhaustive treatment of Anton, stud. II 180 ff.

⁴ officinis‚‘ accidentally omitted in the MSS„ is necessary, for ‘ rhetorum '
cannot be made dependent upon ‘spatiis’ The instrumental abL, espe-
cially in the ease of ⁴ spatiis,' seems to me also out of place. I insert ‘ex ’
before both nouns, on the basis of the original passage. ⁴ Consequi ex

, aliqua re’ is quite common, e. g. Cic. pro Pomp. 1, 2 ex vestro iudicio

fructum est amplissimum consecutus Quint. VII 2, 42 ex qua (sc. poena)
minus incommodi consecuturus quam ex facto gaudii. On the repetition of
the preposition in adversative clauses, see crit. note c. 10 25.

29 sunt aliae causae, magnae et graves: The same phrase occurs
in Plin. Ep. Ι 19, 1 magnae et graves causae V 8, 6 egi m. et g.
causas—Both adj. are used as synonyms also in Tac. H. II 59
quamvis magna transibat, inpar euris gravioribus.

30 vobis aperiri aequum est: On the so—called dativus subjec-
tivus see note c. 4 8.

quoniam like ‘ quando ’ is frequently intensified, esp. in Cicero, by
‘quidem’ See Landgraf, pro Rose. Am. 11, 31 R. V. III 291 note 432 Β.
But the further addition of ‘iam' renders it somewhat doubtful, whether
‘ quidem’ is here in its proper place. Ι am strongly inclined to think, that
it originally belonged after ‘ magnae‚' having been accidentally transferred
to the line below, after ‘ quoniam.' ‘magnae quidem' would then be equal
to ‘magnae illae quidem,' on which see note c. 3 8. Cf. also the exactly
similar passage in e. 34 18 nec praeceptor deerat, optimus quidem (i. e. opt.
ille quidem) et electissimus. — Andresen strangely takes ‘quidem ego’ as

an anastrophe (1) of ‘ego quidem.' 1 have been unable to find a parallel
instance of this hyperbaton in Tacitus.

31 in consuetudine: On these prepositional phrases, see note e.
18 17.

32 si haec audierint: This phrase again betrays the non-histori-
cal character of the dialogue. Cf. note c. 14 20.

33 dum· · - laudo: Dum with the ind. pres. in oratio obliqua or
within a subj. clause is rare in classic Latin. In Cic. only once, in
a translation of a verse of Simonides (Tusc. Disp. I 42, 101). It
occurs sporadically in Livy e. g. XXIV 19, 3, is not uneommon in
Silver Latin, but never found e. g. in Quintilian, Pliny and Sueto-
nius. Most frequent, if not the rule, in Tacitus: G. 12 H. Ι 33
III 38. 70 V 17 Ann. II 81 ΧΙ 33 XIII 15 XIV 58 XV 2. 45.
