c. 21. 237

Ganus.-siooua=‘aridus‚ exilis, inanis, ieiunus, strigosus ξηρός’
opposed to ³uber, plenus.’ Cf. Quint. XI 1, 32 siccum et solli-
citum et contractum dicendi propositum Gell. XIV 1, 32 sicca et
incondita et propemodum ieiuna and Quint. X 2, 17 tristes et
ieiuni Pollionem aemulantur. -Although Aper does not shrink
from exaggeration and misrepresentation, if it suits his purpose,
I cannot believe that he here intends to say that Asinius faithfully
reproduced the style and manner of the old poets throuqhout his
orations no less than in his tragedies. It seems much more natural
and plausible to assume that his contention, be it true or false,
was this: In the tragedies of Asinius, Pacuvius and Accius live
over again and even in his speeches we constantly find the same
archaic flavor.

All that is necessary to bring out this meaning is the insertion of ‘in'
before ‘ orationibus,’ which easily dropped out. owing to the preceding ⁴ m.’
The capricious change from an instrumental abl. to a prepositional phrase,
though peculiarly characteristic of Tacitus, is still rare in the minor writ-
ings. Cp. Kucera‚ Die tacit. Inconcz‘nnz'tc'tt p. 16 Dr. Stil ξ 105. The
present instance, however, as well as c. 31 35, is not a case in point, for in
both these passages a difference of meaning] is involved. Cf. crit. note c.

13 20.

oratio autem sicut corpus hominis: A beautifully elaborated meta-
phor. On the favorite characterisation of stylistic or rhetorical
qualities by terms relating to the human body, see note c. 21 4.
To the parallel instances there cited, add c. 31 19 f. orator . . . tenebit
venas animorum et . . . adhibebit manum et temperabit orationem
Cic. de orat. I 52, 223 orator teneat oportet venas cuiusque generis
Plin. Ep. V 8, 10 hanc (sc. historiam) saepius ossa, musculi, nervi,
illam (sc. orationem) tori quidam . . . decent.

37 nec per ipsum stetit: ³ cannot even be held responsible in his
own person,' a common idiom usually followed by ‘ quominus,'
rarely by ³ quin' or ³ ne.’ Nec=ne —- quidem as in c. 8 26, where see
note. Cp. also G. 6 Ann. XI 30 XII 43 XIV 55 and Dr. H. S.11 73.

39 videmus enim quam: ‘for we observe, how little! This sig-
nification of ³ quam,' especially after ³ videre ' is also idiomatic and
frequent in Cicero. Cf. Rhet. ad Her. IV 20 videt . . . quam conveniat
Cic. de orat. II 31, 133 ut videatis quam sit genus hoc (³ how unim-
portant! Wilkins less justly, it would seem, reads quale with
codd. mutili) 42, 180 vide quam sim . . . deus ³ how far I am from
being a god in such matters ' III 14, 51 vides quam alias res agamus
