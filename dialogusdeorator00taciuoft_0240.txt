H. Ι 16, 50 II 38, 4 III 49 totius orbis V 25 totius orbis. The
fuller and classic form also occurs e. g. Ag. 31 G. 45 H. I 4, 1010
orbe t. III 60 IV 3. 58 Ann. XV 13 toto t. orbe.

urbis, the emendation 01 Pithoeus, has nothing in its favor, for the exag-
geration implied in orbis is especially appropriate to Aper’s character, as
drawn by the author. Cf. e. g. c. 518 totius imperi . . notitiam c. 8 4
non minores in extremis partibus terrarum. Totius, moreover, suits orbis

better than urbis. See the examples just given and H. I 73 totius civitatis
gratiam obtinuit.

12 gratia subnixos: Cf. Ann. XIII 6 g. subnixum. Τ. seems to
have been fond of this word. Of. H. I 73 Α1111. Ι 11. 47 IV 12. XI
1. XII 25. 54. It is not found in Quintilian. -111 summa rerum
omnium abundantia: Aper again exaggerates in order to make his
point more effective. In Cicero, we find omnium rerum ab. (copia),
e. g. Brut. 93, 320 Lael. 23, 87 (16 leg. ag. II 97. Cf. also August.
de cogn. ver. 9 omnimoda omnium deliciarum abundantia—Ob-
serve the concessive force of the preposition. 80 G. 19. 24 Ann.

13 togatorum comitatus et egressus: Toqati the better classes
as opposed to the ‘tiers etat' called tunicatus populus in c. 7 16.

John takes the word in the sense of clientes, quoting Ann. XVI
27, but this restricted meaning of the term is not in keeping with
the context—comitatus et egressus (repeated in Maternus’ reply

” o. 11 13) must not be taken as hendiadys. Andresen well observes

that egressus, strictly speaking, refers to the orator himself and
only secondarily to the retinue of his admiring followers. Cf.
Ann. XV 53 11111110 comitatu ventitare domum, egressibus adhaere·
· scere, and Iuv. VII 141 with Mayor's notes.

Livy: III 71 XLV 7 and not uncommon in Silver Latin e. g. Sen.
Suas. VI 27 Quint. XI 3, 156 Ρ1111. Ep. IV 9,18.—adsistendi is
perhaps best understood in the military sense, very frequent in
Tacitus, of taking one's position in the ranks ready for action;
:adstare, in c. 19 20 20 83=auxilio adesse e. g. c. 39 18 and H.
III 31 orant ut causae suae deprecator adsistat.

younger Seneca. — coire: An acc. with inf. as the subject, with an
