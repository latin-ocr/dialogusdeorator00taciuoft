’ to mention the disputed passage in Ann. IV 33 tum quod antiquis
oratoribus rarus obtrectator, on which see Ful-neaux and Ioh.
Miiller, Beitr. III p. 46 ff., Ι recognise in Ag. 34 quos quod tandem
invenistis, non restiterunt sed deprehensi sunt, a very similar
construction—invicem se obtrectaverunt: Invicem on the analogy
of ‘inter se‚' its classical equivalent, is generally used without
an additional ¹ se' and so invariably elsewhere in Tacitus, barring
one exception in Ag. 6 invicem se anteponendo. Similar examples
are by no means rare in Silver Latin e. g. Plin. Ep. III 7 , 15 cuin
invicem se mutuis exhortationibus amici ad amorem immortalitatis
exacuunt Pomp. Mela III 52 se invicem infestant Ps. Quint. Decl.
p. 194, 25. 258, 6 Β. Acrost. Plaut. Men. 10 ibi se cognoscunt
fratres postremo invicem. Cp. Hartmann, ΑνοΙιίυ ΙΙΙ 290 and esp.
Thielmann, ibid. VII 362-366, 388, also Schmalz‚ Αητὶὸ. p. 718 f.

Nipperdey (Rhein. Mus. XIX 571 f. and Anu. XIV 17) to whom the
above passages were unfortunately unknown, refused to accept ‘invicem se ’
as correct Latin. The very awkward exception in the Agricola he promptly
disposes of by gravely laying down the rule that ‘se’ may be added, for
the sake of clearness, if the verb can also govern a dative case, a rule which
its author abandons at once by deleting ‘se ’ in our passage, apparently
fot-getting that ‘obtrectare' with the acc. of the peison in place of the
dative is found only here.

24 et· · -epistulis eorum: Cf. c. 18 22 ff. On the affirmative
use of ‘et,' very common in Tacitus, see LeX. Tac. s. v. p. 103.

25 hominum ‘human nature.' In this sense, also in Tac. H.
IV 74 Ann. I 61. Cp. humanae infirmitatis vitium, below.

26 Asinium: Asinius Pollio, though well-known as a malevolent
critic (cp. Teuffel §221, 6) had not been included by Aper in c.
18 20 to which passage Messalla expressly refers. But this incon-
sistency, as Vahlen, Prooem. 1878s9 p. 6 has pointed out, is no
more open to criticism than the similar instances of incongruity in
c. 3 20 or 25 31, where see notes.

‘et invidere’ has generally been athetised as an explanatory gloss to
‘livere,’ but, as John, Correspbl. p. 31 has convincingly shown, the two
verbs are by no means synonymous and, even if they were so, the deletion
of one of them would not be justifiable, in view of the fondness for syno-
nymic collocations which characterises this treatise. The genuineness of
finvidere’ is, moreover, clearly demonstrated by the observation that
‘ceteri' and also ‘alii' invariably refer back to a substantive antecedent
which, with thereading hitherto adopted, could only be supplied from the
infinitive. This difficulty is disposed of by the easy correction of ‘livere ’
into ‘ livore.’
