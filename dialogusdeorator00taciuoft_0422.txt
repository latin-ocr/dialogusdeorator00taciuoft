the demonstrative pronoun in Tacitus, 566 the numerous examples
in LeX. Tac. 5. V. and note 6. 12 9. Cp. also Cic. ad Att. X 11, 3
sunt tolerabilia . . . hac iuventute—Proprius, without a genit. or
dative, often expresses a specific idea as opposed to a more general
statement. So in Tac. Ann. ΙΙ 77 propria mandata XV 74 tum
dona et grates deis decernuntur propriusque honos soli. See Peter's
note ad loc., who takes hisznostris, on the analogy of 6. 32 13
huius quoque cotidiani sermonis, an interpretation not essentially
different from the one given.

There is certainly no valid reason for departing from the MS. reading.
‘ eius' no less than ‘huius' (56. urbis) would be tautological by the side of
‘ vernaculis,' on which see following note.

 

vernaculis =‘native Roman.' Cf. Nipp. to Tac. Ann. I 31 verna· ⁷

cula multitudo (= ἀστικὸς ὄχλος in Dio Cass. LVII 5, 4) nuper acto
in urbe dilectU, Heraeus to Tac. H. II 88 vernacula utebantur

urbanitate, and Varr. L. L. V* 77 aquatilium vocabula partim sunt ’

vernacula partim pereyo-ina Mart. X 76, 4 de plebe Remi Numae-
que verna, on which word Festus remarks : Romanos vernas appel-
labant, id est ibidem natos.

10 vitiis: Here personified, as in Ov. Am. III 4, 11 vitia inritare
vetando. - natos=liberi is a poetic word and very rare in classical
prose, where it is always joined to ‘parentes' or similar expres-
sions. Cf. Cic. Lael. 8, 27 Liv. I 23, 1 V 40, 3 viri natique C. I.
L. Π 2900 mariti et nati. Alone as here, also Val. MaX. VII 6 ext.
and a few times in the Church FatherS. Cp. A. Funk, ‘ Was lwissen.
dic Kinder ? ² in Archiv VII 7 3-102 (on nati p. 86), who strangely
overlooked the fact that well-nigh all the Latin designations for
¹ offspring’ occur in this and the following chapter. Cf. liberi (1. 12),
filius, (l. 13), suboles (l. 17) pueri (l. 20), infans (c. 29 1) parvuli (l. 7).
Το these we may add from Tac. ‘pignora' (Ag. 38 G. 7 Ann. XII 2
XV 36 XVI 26) and ³ puerperia ’ (Ann. XII 6).

11 cumulantur: Observe the abandonment of the figure intro-1
(luced by ‘ quae . . . excipiunt,' and see note 6. 10 21. —- prius· · ·
praedixero : For the pleonasm, cf. note 6. 18 7. — severitate ac
disciplina: Hendiadys as shown by c. 29 17 H. I 51 severitate di·-
sciplinae. Cf. also c. 40 9 severissima disciplina Ann. VI 15
severa patris disciplina. The same collocation, but in inverted
order, occu-rs in l. 24 G. 25 Bell. Alex. 48.

12 circa with a gerundive occurs a number of times in Quintilian
e. g. IV 1, 9. 7, 36 VI 2, 25 and occasionally in other post-Aug..
