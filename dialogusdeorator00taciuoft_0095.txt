But if the Dialogue‚ barring a certain historical baekground and
a tolerably faithful portraiture of the interlocutors themselves,
must be regarded as a work of the creative imagination‚ the
question as to the sources which the author consulted and utilised
at once assumes an independent and intrinsic importance.

That Cicero's works were the chief and foremost of these Sources
is universally admitted and sufficiently clear from the foregoing.
But that the youthful author's indebtedness to the great orator
extends far beyond phraseological imitation and the repetition of
dramatic motives‚ is made equally manifest by the astonishingly
large number of reminiscences of Ciceronian ideas in general.
Indisputable analogies in other ancient writers would alone have
amply warranted the assumption that Tacitus' appropriations were
not restricted to the passages expressly cited from Cicero.¹³⁰
Happily we are not confined to mere inferences‚ justifiable though
they be, for the singularly fortunate preservation of the originals
themselves still enables us to determine not only the precise extent
of this indebtedness, but what is incomparably more interesting
and instructive, we can also observe in what manner the writer
assimilated and utilised his borrowed material. Some of the more

(c. 32 27) de orat. (c. 35 5), to which may be added Tiro's Life of Cicero (c. 17 7).
The following orations are incidentally alluded to: pro Tullio, pro Caecina
(c. 203 f.)‚ pro Archia, pro P. Quintio, in Catilinam, the Philippics (c. 38 25 ᾖ),
pro C. Cornelio, pro M. Scauro, pro L. Bestia, in P. Vatinium (c. 39 20), pro
Milone (3827 39 21), in Verrem (c. 203 38 27). Finally the general statements
in c. 3019 in libris Ciceronis deprehendere licet and c. 38 12 neque Ciceronis . . .

liber apud centumviros dictus legatur also seems to imply a profound knowledge
of Cicero's writings.
