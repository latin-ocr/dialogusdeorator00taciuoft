province of Achaia which he could have visited for any educational
purpose—omnem omnium artium varietatem: Of the nine ‘libe-
rales artes ' enumerated by Varro, five are here expressly mentioned,
two clearly implied, namely rhetoric, for according to the Brutus,
Cicero's teachers in Asia were rhetor-iciam· (hi tum in Asia rhetorum
principes numerabantur) and astroloqy (astronomy) which is in-
cluded in ‘ rerum motus causasque.’ The remaining ³ artes,' medicine
and architectum are designedly omitted for obvious reasons. On
the number and variety of the liberal arts from Varro to the time
of Charlemagne, see Th. Davidson, Aris-totle and Ancient Educa-
tional Ideals, London 1892 p. 239-247 (Appendix). —With the
expression itself, cf. Cic. de orat. III 19, 72 veteres illi . . . omnem
omnium rerum . . . cognitionem et scientiam cum dicendi ratione
iungebant. See also note e. 6 12 and Gericke, de abund. qen. dic.
Tac. p. 52 ff.

21 itaque hercule· · · possit: Observe the consummate art with
which the author, by the use of emphatic exclamation (hercule),
anaphora (non —non—non—non denique and ille —ille — ille)
epanalepsis, climaX, evenly balanced clauses, and an accumulation
of synonymous or redundant expressions succeeds in reflecting
stylistically the warmth of feeling and intensity of conviction
which animates the speaker in this elosing part of his argument,
and this in spite of the fact that the entire paragraph betrays an
unmistakable indebtedness to Ciceronian passages both in thought
and phraseology.'— The necessity of acquiring as universal a know-
ledge as possible is constantly inculcated by Cicero. Cf. e. g. de
orat. I 6, 20. 13, 58. 16, 72. 35 ff. II 9, 38 III 14, 54. 20, 76 Brut.

branches here enumerated also Quintilian e. g. I 4, 5. 8, 12. 10, 1 ff.

23 ita est enim· · · ita est: An instance of epanalepsis, a figure
used in solemn or emphatic asseverations, e. g. Cic. Verr. II 4, 52,
117 est ita iudices, est ita Dem. de cor. 297 ἀλλ’ οὐκ ἔστιν, οὐκ ἔστιν,
Olynth. IV 18 εἰσὶ γὰρ, εἰσίν. The expression ita est is particularly
common in Seneca. Of. also Cic. pro Cluent 35, 96 non fuit illud
igitur iudicium iudicii simile, iudices, non fuit. —In Tacitus, euim
always precedes est, except here. In c. 31 6 the MSS. vary. On
this much disputed question, cp. Hand, Tursell. ΙΙΙ 492 Dr. H. S.
