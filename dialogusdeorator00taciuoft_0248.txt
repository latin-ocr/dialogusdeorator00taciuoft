datio either in maius or in minus. Again‚ it is not easy to see why crIminal
cases, which are mentioned first, should afford a livelier satisfaction than
civil suits (apud centumviros) ς the contrary rather might be inferred from
D. 38 10 Quint. V 10, 115 Plin. Ep. V 13, 3. (2) John seems to forget that
Aper is the speaker who, so far from regarding the friends of the emperor
as ‘verrufen,’ lauds them to the skies and praises their happy lot. Aper
nowhere, like Helvidius Priscus, displays the faintest indignation at the
imperial regime, under which he, indeed, though a novus homo, had at-
tained to the praetorship. (3) We fail to leam, why an able advocate
should be incapable of acquiring a great reputation by undertaking the
defence of a libertus prinpris. (4) If the defence of the friends of an
emperor had really been less willingly undertaken‚ because of any fancied
opprobrium attaching to it, we should scarcely find the last member of the
alleged anti-climax emphasised by an accumulation of two synonyms, and
illos should be changed to istos. Ribbeck, leh. Mus. XXVIII p. 503,
endeavors to establish a climax by a violent transposition, which defles
palaeographical explanation, and is in any case superfluous and therefore
false.

6 centumviri: Cp. Fest. Epit. 54 cum essent Romae XXXV
tribus . . terni ex singulis tribubus sunt electi ⁴ad. iudicandum qui
. . licet V amplius quam C fuerint, tamen, quo facilius nomina-
rentur, Oviri sunt dicti. In Pliny's day (Ep. VI 33) the number had
risen to 180. On the cases that came within the jurisdiction of this
court, cf. Quint. IV 2, 5 cum de re constat, de iure quaeritur ut
apud centumviros. Esp. Cic. de orat. Ι 38, 173 With Wilkins' note
and Smith, Diot. Ant. I p. 404 f.

7 Libertus, procuratores: On the position and the great power
wielded by freedmen under the various emperors, cp. Friedlander
I 82-104 (Vespasian p. 93). ‘Procuratores' were officers in the
imperial household and generally freedmen. Cp. Smith, Diot. Ant.
ΙΙ 496-99. If the statement of Sueton. Vesp. 16 ‘creditur etiam
procuratorum rapacissimum quemque ad ampliora officia ex indu-
stria solitus promovere quo locupletiores mox condemnaret' be
true, they must have had frequent occasions to avail themselves of
the eloquence of great orators.

8 tueri et defendere. The same synonyms combined in G. 14
illum defendere, tueri and frequently in Cicero e. g. de orat. I 38,
172 de fin. ΙΙ 4, 11 ad fam. 13, 64. Caes. B. C. III 94.—datur:
The passive of dare with inf. in Tac. only here and in the Annals ε
ΙΙΙ 67 (where see Draeger), IV 60 (defendere daretur) VI 5. 19
XII 23. Cp. E. Opitz, Progr. Naumburg 1852 p. 15, Dr. H. S. II
367 f. Stil. p. 59. The active form with inf. is poetic, in prose
