that Tacitus, here too, as elsewhere, may simply have followed in
the footsteps of ο116 01· more previous writers, and this seems in
fact· to have been the case.

The education of children was frequently made the subject of
monogr-aphia treatment by the ancients‚ more particularly by the
Οτι-66118397 The originals have unfortunately been entirely lost, or
preserved only in meagre and insignificant fragments, but among
these Chrysippos' Περὶ παίδων ἀγωγῆς seems to have been the most
extensively used, Its popularity was not so much due to any
originality of treatment, stylistic charm 01· profundity of observa-
tion, for the Stoic Chalcenteros was not distinguished for any of
these qualities, but rather to the accumulation of the opinions of
others,¹⁹⁸ which could not but make his compilations a repository
of useful information, highly welcome to later writers. We are
accordingly not surprised to find that Quintilian, in discussing the
education of children, has recourse to this identical treatise os
Chrysippos, and, what has hitherto escaped notice, that the un-
known author of Περὶ παίδων ἀγωγῆς, which has come down to us
under Plutarch's name, is also indebted for some of his material to
the same Stoic source. The indisputable proof of this is furnished
by the following passages :

QuInt. 1 1, 4 Ante omnia ne sit viti· Ps. Plut. c. 5 τάς γε τίτθας καὶ τροφοὺς,

osus sermo nutricibus quas, si fieri ού τὰς τυχούσας, ἀλλ’ ὥς ἔνι μάλιστα
posset, sapientes Chrysippus optavit, σπουδαίας δοκιμαστέον ἐστί c. 6 ζητη-
certe quantum res pateretur, opti· τέον πρώτιστα τὰ μὲν σπουδαῖα τοὺς
mas eligi voluit. et morum quidem τρόπους ἔτι μέντοι Ἑλληνικὰ. καὶ περί-
in his haud dubie prior ratio est. τρανα λαλεῖν ἵνα μὴ συναναχρνωνύμενοι
βαρβάροις.

et receptum sit et Chrysippus non τὰ καλὰ τῶν ἐπιτηδευμάτων άγειν πα-
improbet, minime velim, primum ραινέσεσι καὶ λόγοις, μὴ μὰ Δία πληγαῖς

de liberis educandis, is known to me.
