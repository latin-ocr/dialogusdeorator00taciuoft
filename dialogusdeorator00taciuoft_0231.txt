c. 5. 87

Aper regards as the only true eloquence. This view is confirmed
by the generic meaning of the word eloquentia in c. 10 13, where it
is made to include poetry as well as oratory. In order, therefore,
to restrict it to the latter only, distinguishing epithets such as
virilis (cf. Cic. ad fam. 1 9, 23 nam me iam ab orationibus diiungo
fere referoque ad mansuetiores Musas) and. oratoria were necessary.

. Cf. also c. 8 14 oratoriae eloquentiae.

14 parere simul et tueri: Tueri carries on the thought of 'parere'
and. we should, therefore, expect ³ ac ⁷ or ² atque‚’ according to Taci-
tean usage pointed out c. 4 3. But here and again below, ‘ propug-
nare pariter et incessere,' the rule is only apparently violated, for
the insertion of simul and pariter has the effect of making the
action expressed by the two verbs appear simultaneous, coalescing,
as it were, into one idea. T. uses ³ simul et ² more frequently than
the classical ‘simul ac’ which is chiefly found in the minor writings.

15 complecti provincias: sc. patrocinio. The insertion of this
word would have destroyed the stylistic equilibrium. For a simi-
lar ellipsis, cf. Ag. 25 amplecti civitates (sc. bello).—omittit stu·
dium quo: John supplies ‘eloquentiae,' to avoid the objection of
Vahlen and Andr-esen that the same idea is here repeated in very
similar language, whereas we expect Aper to speak of two occupa-
tions of Maternus, one of which he neglects, while devoting himself
assiduously to the other. I see no reason for departing from
the usual interpretation which supplies in thought an ‘id’ before
studium. The alleged repetition is occasioned by the design of
the author to depict Aper as a trained rhetorician who carefully
enumerates the various subdivisions of his argument which he
subsequently discusses in regular order. It is strange that John,
who makes the same observation, did not see that it renders his
own suggestion superfluous. —The passage from qua . . potest con-
tains two climaxes, one asyndetic, the other polysyndetic. The
last member of the second is moreover amplified to give a sonorous
finish. For eXX. of this peculiarly Tacitean device, see the long
list in Weinkauff, p. 92-97.

17 urbis is best taken as a subjective genitive, for the analo-
gous expressions which immediately follow are clearly not ob-
