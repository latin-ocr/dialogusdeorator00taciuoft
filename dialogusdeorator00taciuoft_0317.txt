no doubt as to his own private convictions. This covert reproof
⁴ and delicate irony is not lost upon Aper, as his reply shows. But
the courteous character of this answer renders it highly improbable
that Messalla had expressed his disapproval of Aper's conduct in
so blunt and insulting a manner as he would have done, if we sup-
pose with Andresen that ‘improbari' (or 'damnali' according to
Halm) had been accidentally omitted after ‘in Apro! See also the
excellent note of Peter ad loc. and Proleg. p. lxv.

common in all periods of the language. Cf. e. g. Plaut. Bacch. IV

2 inridere atque contemnere: Contempt follows ridicule, hence
“ atque,' according to the usage pointed out c. 4 3. The same collo-
cation also 111 Cic. de leg. agr. ΙΙ 35, 96 irridebunt atque conte-
mnent. On the ‘laudatio temporis acti,' cf. Ann. II 88 dum vetera
extollimus, recentium incuriosi III 55 nec omnia apud priores meli-

Vacerra, solos Ι 1166 laudas nisi mortuos poetas. See also note to c.
18 16 where other illustrations of this often recurring thought are
cited. The question as to the superiority of the ancients over the
model-ns is discussed frequently under various forms in ancient
literature and then reappears in France in the seventeenth century.
The particular controversy regarding the decline of eloquence from
older standards seems to have reached its cuhnination in the reign
of Nero, and had practically become a dead issue when Quintilian
wrote his Institutio See e. g. X 1, 122 and cf. esp. Proleg. pp.
xxxn-xxxw. ⁴
