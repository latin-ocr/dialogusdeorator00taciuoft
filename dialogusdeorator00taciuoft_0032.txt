xxviii PROLEGOMENA.

the Tacitean authorship altogether or of accepting the psychological
impossibility that one and the same writer at one and the same
time was capable of employing two kinds of style, so different as
that employed in the Dialogus and in the Agricola and Germania.

The πρῶτον ψεῦδος in this seemingly cogent and logical argumen-
tation is the utterly unwarranted assertion that the quaestor P.
Cornelius Tacitus, who at the early age of 23 s24 had become the
son-in-law of the consul Agricola,'then in the zenith of his fame,
could not have designated himself as ³ iuvenis admodum ² in refer-
ence to the time, when he at the age of 20s21 was pursuing his
studies under the guidance of Aper and Secundus! The indis-
putable fact has, moreover, often been pointed out that in no other
period of a man's life will even a few years work greater changes
than in the interval between youth and early manhood, and if this
is the case with men of average intellectual endowment, how much
more true must it have been in a man of genius, such as Tacitus
admittedly was. That the greatest Roman historian received a
most thorough rhetorical training, that he acquired high distinction
as an orator at an early age are facts denied by no one,³³ and if any
doubt as to his precocity still remained, it would be dispelled by the
following famous and often cited letter of Pliny (VII 20, 3): erit
rarum et insigne duos homines aetate et dignitate propemodum
aequales nonnullius in litteris nominis alterurn alterius studia
fovisse, equidem adulescentulus (Pliny was born 62 Α. 1).) cum iam
tu fama qloriaque florere-3, te sequi, tibi longo sed proximo inter-
vallo et esse et haberi concupiscebam. et erunt multa clarissima

ausgebildet.’ It is also worthy of notice that Andresen in his last edition, and
in his revision of Nipperdey's Annals, tacitly omits all reference to the alleged
execution of Maternus in 91 A. n. and the inference based upon it that the
Dialogus was a kind of In Memoriam tribute l See esp. his Tac. als Schullectilre
p. 322 f. This latter view is well, though superfluously, refuted by Weinkauff
p. LVIII.

33 Cp. Eckstein p. 70 ff. Haase p. VII f. XVI. LI. That Tacitus, like his
friend Pliny, enjoyed the instruction of Quintilian is highly probable (cf. e. g.
Liebert‚ de doctrina Tac. p. 4 ff), in-spite of Wutk's contention to the contrary
(p. XI ff.): ‘ Cur ei (sc. Quintiliano) operam navaret Tacitus, viginti iam anno-
rum iuvenis, quem tum vel brevi post ad causas agendas animum convertisse
conicio (! 52) — et cur ad Quintilianum se conferret, cum Messallam, quem arcta
familiaritate complexus esse videtur (H. 111 9 IV 42), sequi posset, qui similia
atque ille sentiret? l! His other arguments are of an equally convincing
character.
