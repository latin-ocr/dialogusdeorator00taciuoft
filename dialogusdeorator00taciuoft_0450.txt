272. 357 and see note c. 31 2. The impersonal use 01 ‘sufficere'
is confined to post-Aug. Lati11.——ad tempus ‘ For the occasion.’ So
also Cic. de orat. 1 16, 69 quid est cur non orator de rebus eis'
eloquentissime dicat quas ad certam causam tempusque cognorit. The
meaning usually given to this phrase ‘for the time being, for the
moment' (See Seyff-Muss. Lael. p. 196, Το0. Α1111. I 1 IV 19)
5001115 1055 appropriate here.

2 uniforme: Apparently not met with elsewhere, except in late
Latin 0. g. Macrob. VH 5 Apul. Met. 11 Aurel. Vict. Epit. 9
Arnob. II 88 (uniformiter).—primum enim etc.: The thought was
perhaps suggested by 010. (10 orat. 111 23, 86 01111105 0111111 artes
aliter ab eis tractantur qui eas ad usum transferunt, aliter ab eis
qui ipsarum artium tractatu delectati, nihil in vita sunt aliud
acturi.

3 longeque interesse: Lonqe is a poetic and post-Aug. equivalent
for multum, multo. 01. Το0. Α1111. IV. 40 longeque antisse patris
mei amicitias non occulti ferunt. c. 33 10 longe magis . . . con-
tineri 24 longe paratiorem G. 8 longe impatientius Ann. IV40
longe acrius arsuras XII 2 1. rectius. For examples in other
writers, see Lexica.

4 possideat - - - an mutuetur: An in indirect question with
‘utrum' omitted, is more common in Tacitus than in other writers.
Cp. Lex. Tac. 5. v. an (p. 7 7) No similar instance occurs in Quin-
tilian. The same ellipsis after ‘interesse' e. g. in Plaut. Most. 11
1, 60 pluma haud interest, patronus an cluens probrior sit.— The
truth 01 the statement is well illustrated by the Dialogus itself
which, 111 spite 01 palpable indebtedness to Cicero and others, has
yet preserved a high degree of originality.

5 etiam aliud agentes: Genuine culture will manifest itself,
even in those parts of a speech in which the orator was not con-
sciously availing himself 01 1115 acquired knowledge. Most 00111-
mentators take the phrase ‘aliud agentes’ to refer to the orator's
extra-forensic activity, his 500101 intercourse and the like, but this
interpretation is quite excluded by the clause ‘idque . . . fateatur!
The phrase itself is originally colloquial usage but 01 common
occurrence and opposed to ‘hoc agere,' ‘to do something inten-
tionally.⁷ 01. Ter. Eun. 348 Hec. 826 Publ. Syr. 115 R. Cic.
Rosc. Am. 22, 60 (where see Landgraf) pro Cluent. 64, 179 aliud
agentem ac nihil eius modi cogitantem de orat. 111 14, 51 Brut.
