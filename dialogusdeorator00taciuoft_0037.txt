the learned were stirred by the dispute regarding nominalism and
realism. The France of the 17 th century is deeply agitated by the
momentous question touching the superiority of the wisdom of the
ancients over that of the moderns. The war, as often, ended in
a compromise. Perrault on his death-bed became reconciled to
Boileau. The same quarrel had been transplanted to England by
St. Evremond3 it is represented by Sir Wm. Temple, Wm. Wotton
(Reflections on Ancient and Modern Learning'), Dryden (Preface
to his translation of the Aeneid)‚ Boyle and Bentley, Swift (Tale
of the Tub and the Battle of the Books). There is scarcely a con—
temporary English writer of repute who was not drawn into the
fray as a partisan. Then suddenly we hear no more of the dispute;
it had ceased to exist. In France, in the 18th century, another
very similar controversy arose in regard to the decline in taste and
the superiority of Homer as an epic poet. The works of Regnier‚
Fenelon, Hardouin, Aubignac, Terrason, Buffon, etc., etc., all resound
with the discussion of this pseudo-momentous issue. Finally, on
April 5, 1716, Mad. Dacier and La Motte signed the articles of
peace, and the latter announced in an alleged poem to a breathlessly
expectant Academy‚ that the war was, indeed, ended, the victory
being, as usual, on neither side.⁴⁰

Now the controversy concerning the decline of eloquence, Ι con-
tend, belongs to the same category of burning issues as those just
enumerated. The identical question was discussed in the days of
Demetrius Phalereus and, in Latin literature, esp. from the 4th-'7 th
decade of the first century, references to the same topic meet us
at every turn. Cp. e. g. Petronius in the very first chapter, Seneca
in his Introduction to the Controversiae, the younger Seneca in his
Epistles‚ and the anonymous author of Περὶ ὕψους in the famous
closing chapter. In the reign of Domitian these voices are hushed.
The controversy had, as in all the instances cited, passed off the
stage. The very existence of Quintilian's Institutio Oratoria bears
eloquent testimony to this fact. He does, indeed, preach a return
to the classic model of Cicero to counteract the pernicious influence
of the emasculated though scintillating style of Seneca, so popular
at the time of his arrival in Rome. But when he wrote his great
work, a more hopeful, optimistic feeling had taken possession of
