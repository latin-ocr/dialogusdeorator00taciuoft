XIII 25. If we substitute ‘ tamen,' Messalla's point is at once brought out
with admirable distinetness ε “Although D. was considered primus omnium
and not primus inter pares, yet (tamen) his age was by common consent
regarded as marking the culmination of Greek eloquence, so the age of
Cicero marks a similar climax in Roman oratory, even though Cicero’s*
immediate contemporaries failed to reach his consummate excellence.''
Cp. also below, omnes tamen.

12 concessu for the usual ‘consenSU,' frequent in Cicero but
rare elsewhere e. g. Caes. B. G. VII 20 Tac. Ann. XII 44.

13 haec oratorum aetas = horum oratorum. On the hypallage,
cf. note c. 2 3.

14 antecessit: Intransitive verbs when compounded with a pre-
position frequently assume a transitive meaning and as such take
the accusative. Examples of this use are chiefly confined to post-
Aug. writers and very common in Tacitus. ‘Antecedere ' is, how-
ever, it must be noted, always construed with the acc. by Caesar,
who uses this verb seven times. Cp. Dr. H. S. I 376-82 Stil p. 20.-
On the remarkable phenomenon that the great orators of Greece as
well as of Rome were contemporaries, cf. Vell. Pat. I 16, 2 f. quis

mirari veromeminem possis nisi aut ab illo visum aut qui illum
viderit.

16 refert quod: Refert followed by ‘quod' seems to be ἅπ. εῖρ.
So once also after ‘interest' in Traian. Ep. ad Plin. 30, 2 neque
enim multum interest quod nondum per numeros distributi sunt
(sc. milites).—With the antithesis, cf. Quint. XII 10, 22 quos
(sc. oratores Attici) ut homines inter se genere similes, differentes
dixeris specie.

17 adstrictior Calvus: adstrictus ‘concisess synonymous with
‘pressus, contractus, collectum (c. 31 22) ἀδιάχυτος (περὶ ὕψους 34)]
Cf. Cic. Brut. 90, 309 contracta et adstricta eloquentia Plin. Ep. Ι
20, 20 qui adstrictius quam qui effusius dicit III 18, 10 ea potius
quae pressius et adstrictius quam illa quae hilarius et quasi exsul-
