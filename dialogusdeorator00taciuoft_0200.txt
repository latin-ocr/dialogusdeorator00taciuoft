1NTRODUCT10N (c. 1-9).—Tacitus havinq been repeatedly requested
by a friend to enumerate the causes of tlte evident decline ⁰f eloquence,
at Zenqth complies by furnisliinq what purports to represent the faith-
ful reproduction from memory of a debate on this very question, which.

the poet Maternus.

1. 1 Iuste Fabi: This Fabius Iustus is very probably identical
with the friend of the younger Pliny (Ep. Ι 5, 11 and VII 2) and
with the L. Fabius Iustus who was cons. suffectus in 102 (cp.
Mommsen, Hermes ΙΙΙ 137).-The transposition of the ‘cog-
nomen' or ‘praenomen’ is rare in classical prose3 the seemingly
earliest instances are in Cicero (pro Mil. 3 Ahala Servilius, De
orat. ΙΙ 62, 253 Vespa Terentius, and some dozen examples in the

laxer and colloquial style of the Epistles). Schmalz (Ueber den ·

Spraclzqebraucli des Asinius Pollio, p. 592) is, therefore, not alto-
gether accurate in attributing the introduction 01n this usage to
Varro (e. g. de R. R. praef. 6, 2 extr„ de L. L. 5, 83). Sporadic
examples are met with in Caesar (e. g. Β. C. ΠΙ 83) and Nepos
(Att. 18) ; in Livy instances multiply and in post-Augustan authors,
beginning with Velleius, this usage has become exceedingly common.

Plailol. XXII 47 6 ff. For Tacitus: R. Macke, Die ro'm. Eiqen-

positions occur in steadily decreasing ratio from the D. (25 ss)
to the 2. part of the Annals (only about 6 (ᾗ). Similar inversions
are found in Greek as early as Dionysius (e. g. Arch. 1 6 Ἀγρίππας
Μενένιος 24 Βάρρων Τερέντιος), which seems to indicate very clearly
that this usage must have been rather more common in his time
than the rarity of its occurrence in the extant literature of the
period would lead us to suppose. ——
