Apollodori: Apollodorus of Perqamon was born about 104 Β. c.
· After teaching in his native city, he emigrated to Rome and in 45
B. c. was selected by Julius Caesar as the tutor of Octavian at
Apollonia. After the assassination of the dictator, he returned to
the capital where he remained, highly honored by his imperial
pupil, till his death at the age of 82. Cf. Strabo XIII 625 Ps.
Luc. Macrob. 23. Quint. III 1, 17. Apollodorus wrote but little,
but his numerous followers, known as Apollodorei, diligently
spread his doctrines, Cf. Quint. ΠΙ 1, 18 Apollodori praecepta
magis ex discipulis cognoscas . . . nam ipsius sola videtur ars edita
ad Matium, quia ceteras missa ad Domitium epistula non cognoscit.
His theory, known to us chiefly from the pages of Quintilian, was
exclusively confined to forensic oratory. Cf. Quint. III 1, 1 Apol-
lodorus contentus solis iudicialibus. See Susemihl l. c. II p. 504-'
507 and the literature there cited.

15 quod si: quod followed by a conditional clause marks the
transition to a stronger statement and usually implies an ellipsis.
Here ‘and hence it will not surprise us to learn that when any one'
ete. This use of the relative pronoun is found occasionally in
early Latin e. g. Plaut. Bacch. 742 Ter. And. 258, very frequently
in Cicero, but thereaster only of sporadic occurrence. In Tae. c. 3
10 41 7 Ag. 16. 26 Ann. III 58. Cp. Dr. H. S. II 51 ff.—odoratus
sc. esse ‘to have got a mere sniff at philosophy) The vulgar
phrase is used by Aper to express his low opinion of the crude
culture of that time. In this figurative sense, ‘odorari’ seems to
occur only here and in Lactant. VII 1, 11 veritatem leviter odora-
tus—philosophiam: On the use of the Greek word, in place of
‘sapientia,' see note 5 32.

16 locum=locus communis, general reflections many of which
are enumerated by Cic. de orat. I 13, 56 (where see Wilkins), and
III 27, 106 f. Cf. also Orat. 36, 126 and Quint. X 5, 12 with
Peterson's note—in caelum laudibus ferebatur: Post-Aug. writers,
following in the footsteps of Livy, show a very decided preference
for 'ferre' in place of ‘effere laudibus' which greatly preponder-
ates in Cicero. In Tac. it occurs but once : Ann. III 72 laudibus
Seianum extulit. Elsewhere the shorter form is used. Cf. H. III 3
Ann. II 13 IV 34. Laudibus tollere, extollere, adtollere, which is
very rare in classical Latin (Cic. ad Att. IV 16, 14 Hor. C. I 21, 9),
is quite common in Tacitus e. g. H. II 90 III 9 Ann. IV 41 XII 11,
XIV 14. Cp. the excellent article by Schmalz Antib. ΙΙ 605.
