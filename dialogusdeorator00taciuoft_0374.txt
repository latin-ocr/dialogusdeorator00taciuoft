Tertull. adv. Iud. 13 and Albinus c. 5 (= Rhet. Lat. Min. p. 527,
2 Η.) in Regum legitur.x Cp. Dr. H. S. 1 62. 485 and esp. Woelfflin,
Archiv ΙΙ 371. ——in Asitium: Probably identical with P. Asitius
who was indicted for the murder of an Egyptian ambassador and‘
successfully defended by Cicero, s‘ee ad Att. IV 15, 8.16, 5 ad
Quint. frat. II 16, 3. In both of these triaIS, Calvus, as we learn
from this passage, appeared as the accuser.

9 studiosorum, used absolutely as a substantive, is chiefly post-
Aug., but also found in Cicero e. g. de opt. gen. 5, 13 laborem
utilem studiosis. Cp. Antib. II p. 554 f.

10 in Vatinium: P. Vatinius, one of the most prominent figures
in the last days of the Republic, a man of unscrupulous character,
and the servile partisan of Caesar in all his ambitious projects.
Cicero attacked him in a speech full of virulent invective which has
come down to us, Calvus' speeches against him, at least three in
number (as shown by ‘secunda'), are generally assigned to the
years 58, 56, 54, B. c. The exact chronology is, however, a matter
of controversy. The first trial was never held, being broken up
by an armed force, and from certain passages in Cicero's letters it
has been argued that there were two trials in 54, in which case
the speech referred to here would be the first of that year, and not
that of the year 56. See Peter's note. It is, however, equally
possible that Calvus subsequently wrote out the speech which he
had been prevented from delivering, just as Cicero did in the case
of Verres. Cf. also note c. 34 35.—-On Vatinius in general, Dru-
mann, Biim. Gesoh. V, 682, Smith Bioyr. Dict. III p. 1233-1235.
These oratorical masterpieces of Calvus are frequently quoted by
Quintilian, grammarians and rhetoricians, and his sensational elo-
quence on one occasion (cf. Sen. contr. VII 4, 8) has been immor·
talised in a well-known poem of Catullus (C. LIII, where see
Ellis’ commentary). Cp. also Sandys⁷ Orat. p. XLVI.

11 verbis ornata et sententiis: Both the style and substance of
the speech i. e. the thoughts as well as the language in which they
are presented satisfy'the requirements of the modern type of ora-
tory. With the phrase itself, cf. Cic. de orat. I 49, 213 et verbis
ad audiendum iucundis et sententiis ad probandum accommodatis
uti possit III 52, 200 tum denique hic nobis orator ita confor-
mandus est et verbis et sententiis Brut. 7 9, 275 erant autem et
verborum et sententiarum illa lumina.
